Supply chain disruptions refer to unexpected events that hinder the normal flow of goods and services in a supply chain. These disruptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as natural disasters, geopolitical events, or technological failures, and can have significant impacts on the global economy and stock markets. From an investment perspective, supply chain disruptions can create both risks and opportunities. On one hand, they can lead to increased costs, reduced revenues, and lower profitability for companies, potentially leading to declines in stock prices. On the other hand, they can also create opportunities for companies that provide solutions to manage and mitigate these disruptions, such as those in the logistics, technology, and risk management sectors. Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of supply chain disruptions in recent years has highlighted the importance of supply chain resilience, leading to increased investments in technologies and strategies to enhance supply chain flexibility and adaptability.

Gold prices are a significant economic indicator and investment asset, influenced by various factors such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Recently, expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve have been driving up gold prices, as lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies. Additionally, gold often serves as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, which can lead to increased demand and higher prices. However, it's important to note that while gold can provide a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations, its performance can be volatile and is influenced by a range of global economic and political factors.

The S&P 500 is up 16% on the year and may continue to rise—but avoid this 1 investing move:
The S&P 500, a measure of the broad U.S. stock market, has returned about 16% so far in 2024, despite a period of violent conflicts abroad and political turmoil domestically. The Federal Reserve has maintained relatively high interest rates, despite predictions of six or seven cuts. However, market watchers believe that the current bull market is not yet over and that there is still some potential for continued growth. The biggest risk for equities is valuation, which could lead to a pullback or muted gains in the second half of 2024. All 11 sectors in the S&T 500 have reported positive returns year-to-date, with six featuring double-digit returns. However financial pros caution against making wholesale changes to your portfolio based on short-term market forecasts.

Despite this, many manufacturers continue to face challenges in planning effectively. The survey identified a significant agile planning gap, with only 16% of companies (all industry) having the right processes and technologies in place to make this a reality. The study also found that 47% of respondents use spreadsheets for at least half of their business planning, a source of potential risk due to manual data entry and lack of real-time data integration.

On the placement of the INF in Germany: the background of the question, what the United States wants and how Russia will respond:
The United States has decided to deploy medium-range (1000 to 5500 km) and shorter-range missiles in Germany in 2026. This decision is part of a broader understanding of the origins of the US decision. The decision was approved by the Anglo-Saxons in 1948 in a memorandum titled "Tasks in relation to Russia". The first time they placed their INF missiles with nuclear warheads in Europe in 1961 was in Turkey. This led to the "Caribbean Crisis", which saw the Soviet Union gain ground in the arms race in the INF missile class. However, the United States and the USSR did not abandon their nuclear policy towards the INF, despite cutting and scrapping its military superiority over NATO. In 1987, the US deployed its INF missiles for the second time in West Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and the Netherlands.

OpenAI Secrets Stolen in 2023 After Internal Forum Was Hacked:
The online forum OpenAI employees use for confidential internal communications was breached in 2023, according to anonymous sources. Hackers stole details about the company's AI technologies, but did not infiltrate the systems where OpenAI houses and builds its AI. The incident was not disclosed to the public as no information about customers or partners was stolen. The breach was a concern for employees who believed it indicated a vulnerability in the company that could be exploited by state-sponsored hackers. This led to some questioning whether OpenAI was doing enough to protect its proprietary technology from foreign adversaries. In May 2024, OpenAI announced it had disrupted five covert influence operations originating in Russia, China, Iran and Israel that used its models for deceptive activity. The company also formed a Safety and Security Committee to develop processes and safeguards while developing its frontier models.

Russia Sends Nuclear Warning To US, Europe:
Russia has warned that it does not rule out new deployments of nuclear missiles in response to the planned U.S. stationing of long-range conventional weapons in Germany. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that the defense of Russia's Kaliningrad region, near NATO military alliance members Poland and Lithuania, was a primary focus for stationing nuclear-capable missiles. The United States announced last week that it would start deploying weapons in 2026, including SM-6, Tomahawk, and new hypersonic missiles, to demonstrate its commitment to NATO and European defense. The missiles that Russia and the United States are considering deploying are intermediate-range ground-based weapons banned under a 1987 U.K.-Soviet treaty. Security experts believe the planned deployments are part of the worst arms race since the Cold War era.

Chip stocks volatile with China-US spat in focus:
Trading in U.S. chip stocks was volatile on Thursday, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index closing higher with contributions from Nvidia and Broadcom. This follows a report that the United States is considering tighter curbs on exports of advanced chip technology to China. The Global X Asia Semiconductor exchange-traded fund closed down 1.74% on Thursday with major holdings including SK Hynix, Tokyo Electron, Taiwan Semiconduct Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics. Some analysts suggested that the near-term probability of the trade curbs would be implemented is low and that current volatility could be an opportunity in companies with best-profitability. However, Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, expects more volatility ahead with chip company earnings due in the coming weeks.

Supply chain troubles persist as industry struggles toward recovery:
The aerospace industry continues to face significant supply chain issues, with some companies aiming to rectify issues by year-end. Airbus head of industrial supply chain and digital operations, Delphine Bazaud, stated that the company is ramping up to meet customer expectations. This comes after Airbus delayed its plan to produce 75 A320neos from 2026 to 2027. Boeing VP Ihssane Mounir said his company's recent production slowdown was an opportunity to put fundamentals in place before production ramps. EY aerospace and consulting leader Raman Ramanathan said the recovery has been slowed due to airlines flying longer than planned due to unexpected component failures and unexpected durability issues from new-generation engines. GE Aerospace reported that its joint CFM International business with Safran Aircraft Engines delivered 297 Leap turbofans in Q2, down 29% year on year.

Decrypting: Supply Chain Attacks Impacting All Apple Devices:
Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the open-source dependency manager “CocoaPods” used in over 3 million iOS and MacOS applications, which could leave most Apple devices vulnerable to supply chain and zero-click attacks. The vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to claim ownership of thousands of unclaimed pods(packages), which can be used to inject malicious code into popular iOS and MACOS applications. The vulnerability was discovered by researchers following a migration process in 2014 that left thousands of pods, many of which are still being used in other libraries. The second vulnerability exploits an insecure email verification workflow to run arbitrary code on a CocoaPod 'Trunk' server, which manages the distribution and metadata of Podspecs. All vulnerabilities have since been patched.

Hacker stole OpenAI secrets in 2023, raising questions about foreign actors hacking AI companies in the future:
OpenAI experienced a major security incident in 2023, raising concerns about the security and safety of AI companies and suggesting that foreign actors may target these companies in the future. The hacker only accessed an employee discussion forum, but the company did not disclose this information publicly. The incident occurred without significant implications for the security of customers or partners. Despite former OpenAI employee Leopold Aschenbrenner's accusations, the company maintains that its security is strong enough to prevent foreign actors from gaining access to the company's secrets. As AI continues to progress at an exponential rate, it is possible that other governments not friendly to the US could attempt to gather secrets through organized hacking operations.

China says appealing US electric vehicle subsidises before WTO:
China has appealed against subsidies granted to the US electric vehicle industry under President Joe Biden's green plan, accusing Washington of implementing "discriminatory, protectionist" policies. The dispute was brought before the World Trade Organization in March, but China has now asked the WTO to set up a panel of experts to investigate the issue. The US law excludes products from China and other WTO members, artificially sets trade barriers and increases costs of the green energy transition. China has denied its industrial policies are unfair and has threatened retaliation to protect its companies' legal rights and interests. This dispute comes amid ongoing disputes between Beijing and Washington over several trade issues, including customs duties, cutting-edge technologies, and a possible ban on social media site TikTok.

WSJ: US Intel Claims Russia Helping Trump:
US intelligence officials have claimed that Russia is working to boost former President Donald Trump's 2024 election efforts. The Russian government is reportedly leading a "whole-of-government" effort to influence the U.S. presidential election. The activities include covert social media use and online propaganda. Officials believe Russia is focusing its efforts on influencing specific voting groups, particularly in swing states, and is working towards influencing members of Congress. Officials also noted that Iran has become increasingly aggressive in its foreign influence efforts, including posing as activists online and providing financial support to anti-Israel protesters. The advent and accelerated use of artificial intelligence could pose an additional risk to potential 2024 election interference, calling it "a malign influence accelerant".

This could impact foreign players like Netherlands-based ASML, which would have to alter its business with China, and even US companies not directly impacted. Shares in AI chipmakers Nvidia and AMD were down more than 6% and 10%, respectively. However, even if November's election brings a new administration, chipmakers might not get relief. The supply-chain base for most of the chip industry is in Taiwan, specifically TSMC, which has been claimed by China. Despite this, there are no immediate industry-wide shifts in the industry due to the ongoing conflict with Taiwan.

New Rumor of an OpenAI Next Level Reasoning Breakthrough:
OpenAI's rumored project, Strawberry, aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of its AI models. The project is reportedly based on the QStar AI advance, which triggered a power struggle inside OpenAI and the temporary firing of CEO Sam Altman. The aim is to enable AI to perform long-horizon tasks (LHT), which require a model to plan ahead and execute a series of actions over an extended period of time. This technology aims to improve AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world, allowing it to autonomously search the internet and conduct deep research. Strawberry uses a specialized way of adapting the base models to hone their performance after they have already been “trained” on generalized data. The method, Quiet-STaR, allows language models to improve their predictions by teaching them to generate rationales or internal thoughts for each piece of text.

Negotiations have been successful over wages and job safety, but the two sides remain divided over the regulation of generative AI.

The U.S. has sanctioned 18 Chinese fabs, dozens remain in in white zone:
China's semiconductor industry has faced significant challenges due to intensified U.S. export controls, particularly targeting blacklisted companies like SMIC, YMTC, and CXMT. The restrictions, imposed by two U.K. governments, aim to prevent Chinese firms from advancing in cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication processes that can boost China's military capabilities. Despite these restrictions, SMIC and CxMT can still obtain chipmaking equipment for fabs that use the so-called trailing nodes. The Biden administration's export controls focus on restricting China's access to advanced chipmaking tools, specifically on leading-edge process technologies that rely on FinFET and gate-all-around (GAA) transistors. Despite this, Chinese chipmakers are collaborating with domestic WFE makers to develop and validate equipment, aiming to create production processes free from tools made in the Netherlands, Japan, and the US. However, this is not true for SMIC operating fabs with no restrictions. The Chinese industry is also focusing on building domestic alternatives across various sectors, including electronic design automation (EDA) tools, advanced materials, and packaging techniques, and is working on key technologies like multi-chiplet designs and 2.5D and 3D back-end packaging technologies.

Stocks Move Higher on Improved Fed Rate Cut Prospects:
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) is up +0.92%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA), and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) are up +1.19%. Stock indexes also rose after the US PPI report rose more than expected, which was largely driven by an outsized jump in trade services. The University of Michigan’s July consumer sentiment index unexpectedly fell to an 8-month low, reinforcing speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at the September FOMC meeting. Banks' earnings also negatively impacted the market, with Wells Fargo down more than -6% after reporting below-consensus Q2 net interest income and JPMorgan slightly lower after reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 sales and trading revenue. The markets are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 7% for the next FOMc meeting and 95% for a subsequent meeting on September 17-18.

OpenAI Whistleblowers File SEC Complaint Over Safety Risks - Employment & Business News:
OpenAI whistleblowers have filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that the company has illegally barred employees from alerting regulators about potential safety risks it poses.

The S&P 500 is on the rise outside of Big Tech as traders become more confident about interest-rate cuts in the near future, leading to hopes that another leg of the bull run could be in the coming days. The equal-weighted index that strips out market-cap bias has posted the best two-week stretch relative to the S&B 500 since November 2020, marking a significant shift from the equal-weightsed index to the benchmark index. This shift comes as optimism over eventual monetary easing is pushing investors away from Big Tech, pushing investors towards the perceived safety of the sector.

Truck driver shortage poses "looming crisis" for supply chain: NatRoad:
The National Association of the National Road Transport Union (NatRoad) has warned of a looming crisis for the supply chain due to a severe shortage of truck drivers in Australia.

Car dealership losses from CDK software outage could soon reach $1 billion, study finds:
CDK Global software provider, CDK Global, has been experiencing software outages that could cost car dealerships a collective $1 billion if not addressed, according to a study by Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group (AEG).

Rhenus Logistics, a global logistics provider, saw July as the "peak of the peak" season, when it was traditionally just the beginning. Nike also started shipping from March to May, earlier than the June to August timeline planned. The new tariffs imposed on some products were also a factor, as companies were trying to beat the timeline on tariffs to save on shipping.

The U.K. gave Ukraine permission on June 1 to use American-supplied weapons, including HIMARS rockets, to target targets in Russia near the border with Kharkiv Oblast after Russia launched a renewed offensive in the region. However, Ukraine is still prohibited from using ATACMS and other long-distance U.M.-supplied arms for strikes deeper inside Russia. Stoljenberg welcomed the decision to ease restrictions on the use of certain weapons to target the border, stating that Ukraine's self-defense includes the right to strike legitimate military targets on the aggressor's territory.

China strongly condemns US’ Xizang-related bill; act may signal Washington’s intention to increasingly play ‘Xizang card’ to suppress China: experts:
China has strongly condemned the US's "Tibet bill", which was signed into law by President Joe Biden, alleging it violates the US government's long-held position and commitments regarding Xizang, China's internal affairs and undermines China's interests. The Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that the bill violated the US’s position, commitments, and sent a wrong signal to separatist forces seeking “Xizang independence” The bill also violated international law and basic norms governing international relations. China's top legislature also condemned the passage and signing into law, stating that the act grossly interferes in China's domestic affairs and violates its sovereignty, security, and development interests. Analysts believe the bill could signal a significant escalation in US's approach to control China's development and could exacerbate tensions between China and the US regarding the issue. The bill provides recognition to the notion of "Greater Tibet" made up by the Dalai group and asks the US and the United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to counter "disinformation about Xizan" from the Chinese government.

U.S. intel officials: Russia wants to boost Trump in 2024 race:
U.S. intelligence officials have stated that Russia is targeting the 2024 presidential race in an effort to boost Donald Trump. This follows a series of pro-Kremlin social media accounts attempting to spread false narratives online, intended to aid Trump. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that there has been no shift in Russia's preferences for the presidential race from past elections, suggesting that Moscow wants Trump in power now. This is particularly acute due to the United States' support for Ukraine. In the past, Russia has targeted U.S elections in both 2016 and 2018, including in 2020, and in 2024, Russia is once against targeting U.K. elections. However, many Republican officials no longer believe Russian intervention is a problem due to their lack of awareness about it.

The Middle East and Africa (MEA) region is becoming a battleground for international tech supremacy in all areas related to enterprise technology, including cloud, radio access networks for enterprise 5G, and artificial intelligence (AI). Huawei has become the first cloud vendor to create a cloud region in North Africa, while UAE-based AI group G42 has secured a $1.5 billion deal with Microsoft by replacing Chinese technology for American hardware. GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, suggests that Chinese vendors are wooing telcos and governments with promise of improved infrastructure and an immediate boost to national economies. However, the threat of US sanctions is preventing many countries from investing in the Chinese technology. Huawei is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in programs across MEA, particularly in Africa, where it is investing $300 million in Egypt alone to support cloud services, develop an ecosystem software and channel partners, and train developers and technology professionals.

The U.S. is reportedly considering imposing a tougher trade rule on allies selling advanced chipmaking equipment to China, and may also ban Nvidia from selling a chip it specifically designed for the Chinese market. The H20 chip, one of three chips designed to not require an export control license, could be banned for sale to China three ways: through a product specific ban, lowering the computing power cap, or increasing memory capacity. Despite efforts to tighten export controls on semiconductor materials sold to the country, firms have reportedly been able to access advanced chips from Nvidia through resellers and even by renting Nvidia-powered servers from Google, Microsoft, and other tech firms. The Biden administration is reportedly debating using the foreign direct product rule, which can block the export of any good to any country if it is manufactured with a certain percentage of US intellectual property components.

China has requested far more patents than any other country in relation to generative AI, according to a report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The technology, which can boost efficiency and speed up scientific discoveries but also raises concerns about jobs and workers, was linked to about 54,000 inventions in the decade through 2023. The report, the first of its kind, aims to track patent applications as a possible indication of trends in artificial intelligence. Over the decade starting in 2014, China had over 38,200 inventions, six times more than the United States, leading by six times. South Korea, Japan, and India also made significant contributions to the patent applications. Critics worry that GenAI could replace workers in some types of jobs or improperly take human-generated content without fair or adequate compensation.

Yardeni Research has increased its 2024 target for the S&P 500 (SP500)(SPY) to 5,800 for the year-end, a move from 5,400. The new projection suggests a nearly 3% upside for the benchmark from its record closing high of 5,633.91. The research also anticipates cooling inflation to lead the Federal Reserve to start interest-rate cuts this year. The odds of a September rate cut increased to +87% in the fed funds futures market after the June Consumer Price Index report showed the headline rate falling 0.1%, the first M/M decline since May 2020. Yardeni has previously predicted that stocks will continue to rise throughout the decade, supported by economic expansion after the COVID pandemic.

Supply-Chain Risk Is Eating the World:
The article suggests that the intersection of compliance and sustainability is really about supply-chain risk, rather than compliance. This comes after Microsoft reported that its carbon emissions from its supply chain jumped by 30.9% in the same period, a significant increase from the previous year. Almost all of Microsoft’s carbon emissions (over 96%), come from the supply chain. The author suggests that compliance officers must also manage the security of your supply chain and avoid human-trafficking or forced-labor violations. This means that companies will need better tools to manage these supply chain issues, including better contract management capabilities and better monitoring tools for supplier behavior. Compliance officers should also be a key player in this effort, but success depends on a working team working together.

OpenAI has developed a voice feature for ChatGPT, allowing the company to voice all of the text generated by the app. The feature, which initially sounded like Scarlett Johansson's voice, has been delayed due to a potential issue with Johansson, who had previously declined a license offer. The company rolled back the voice and delayed the launch. The realistic voice, which can replicate human speech, is now being tested for users and is expected to be released to all ChatGpt Plus users in the fall. However, users will not be able to impersonate other people or public figures using this feature.

Logistics challenges, flooding cause of fuel queues – NNPC - EnviroNews - latest environment news, climate change, renewable energy:
The Nigerian National Petroleum Council (NNPC) Ltd has reported that fuel queues in the FCT and some parts of the country are due to disruption of ship-to-ship transfer of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol, caused by a recent thunderstorm. The adverse weather conditions have also affected berthing at jetties, truck loadouts, and transportation of products to filling stations. The NNPC Ltd stated that due to flammability of petroleum products and compliance with Nigerian Meteorological Agency regulations, it was impossible to load petrol during rainstorms and lightning. The flooding has also impacted truck routes and has constrained movement of PMS from the coastal corridors to the Federal Capital, Abuja. NPC Ltd is working with stakeholders to resolve the logistics challenges and restore seamless supply of petrol to affected areas.

Biden administration reveals plans to prevent Chinese steel from entering US:
The US government is planning to close loopholes that allow China to evade tariffs by exporting steel and aluminum to the US through Mexico. The White House will sign a proclamation allowing steel from Mexico to receive duty-free benefits if it's melted and poured in Mexico, and importers will have to share information on the origin of their steel products. This move is part of a joint announcement between President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Estimates suggest that 3.8 million tons of steel arrived in the US from Mexico in 2023. The Canadian government confirmed in May that it would not function as a "back door" for Chinese steel and aluminium. This follows the announcement of new and higher tariffs on China in spring.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin met with their Philippine counterparts in Manila to reaffirm Washington's commitment to its oldest treaty ally in Asia. The funding is described as unprecedented and sends a clear message of support from the Biden-Harris administration, the US Congress, and the American public. The Philippines has competing claims with China in the waters to its west, which China claims 90% of the sea. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that China's claims had no basis under international law.

Rupert Murdoch in secret battle with three of his children over future of media empire:
Rupert Murdoch is embroiled in a secret legal battle with three of his children over the future of the family's media empire. The dispute stems from Murdoch's surprise move to alter the terms of the Murdochs' irrevocable family trust to ensure that his eldest son, Lachlan, would remain in control of his vast collection of television networks and newspapers. The trust currently hands control of the business to the four oldest children when Murdoch dies, but Murdoch argues that only by empowering Lachling to run the company without interference from his more politically moderate siblings, he can preserve its conservative editorial bent. A trial to determine whether Murdoch is acting in good faith is set to begin in September. The future of Murdoch's politically influential media empire hangs in the balance.

China turns to supercomputers for AI development amid US chip sanctions:
China is turning to supercomputers for AI development amid US sanctions, which have limited access to advanced semiconductors and chip-making equipment. Experts suggest that China's supercomputing technology could help overcome these restrictions. Zhang Yunquan, a researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), emphasised the importance of supercom computing systems for training large language models (LLMs). These models underpin generative AI services like ChatGPT and could replace power-hungry data-centre computing clusters that typically use 10,000 to 100,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) for such training. Despite this, China's AI progress remains hampered by limited GPU choices due to US sanctions. Nvidia is reportedly working on a version of its flagship AI chips for the Chinese market compatible with current US export controls.

The VanEck SemiconductorETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconduct ETF (SOXX), the two largest semiconductor-focused ETFs, fell 7% a piece following reports that the Biden administration is considering intensifying trade restrictions on semiconductor companies that do business with China. These restrictions would mostly impact semiconductor firms based in allied foreign nations, like Japan and the Netherlands, who have continued to business with them despite the U.S. chip industry claims that these policies have cost American companies billions of dollars in revenue. However, shares of ASML, the Dutch maker of lithography systems, fell nearly 13% on Wednesday.

The amount spent on these homes was significantly less. The decline in foreign investment could impact the U.K. housing industry in several ways, including reducing competition in certain markets and potentially reducing demand for luxury properties. However, experts believe this could potentially lower home prices. Despite this, home buying in the U., particularly in certain states, is still popular.

Report Finds US Military Lacks Ability to Defeat China, Suggests Cold War Style Defense Spending:
A congressional report by the Commission on the National Defense Strategy has found that the US military lacks the capabilities and capacity to defeat China, suggesting that the military could lose a potential war against the communist regime. The report, published on July 30, found that ‘the U.S. military lacks both capabilities and confidence to deter and prevail in combat. It also highlighted the potential for a near-term war with China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia as a major strategic shift that the U.K. defense planners failed to fully account for. The Commission's vice chair, Eric Edelman, warned that China's increasing military development could increase the likelihood of a conflict between the two countries and the likelihood that the United States could lose. The commission recommends that the national strategy be radically transformed by moving away from the "bipolar" Cold War strategic model to a "multi-theater model" that accounts for the possibility of armed conflicts against multiple nation states simultaneously. It suggests that increasing taxes and increasing defense spending levels and increasing taxes on defense industries could offset this.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI have shut down a covert Russian bot farm used to spread disinformation across social media, X. The DOJ alleges that state-controlled Russian broadcaster RT and the Federal Security Service (FSB) developed a bot farm on X to spread misinformation and sow discord in the US and other countries. The bot farm was controlled by two fake domain names and was used to generate photos, videos, and text that was posted to X. Many of these posts contained pro-Kremlin content, aimed at boosting support for Putin and the war in Ukraine. In a joint effort with the FBI and Dutch intelligence agencies, the DOJ seized two domains and 968 accounts on X.

US, Canada Intercept Russian, Chinese Bombers As Biden Steps Aside:
US, Canada, and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted Russian and Chinese military planes near Alaska, 2024. The incident occurred as U.S. President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside to pass on power to a new generation. Despite the announcement, Russia and China increased their pressure by challenging American forces in international airspace. The North American Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) where the planes were detected, was deemed not a threat as they did not violate US or Canadian sovereign airspace. China's Defense Ministry downplayed the incident, stating it was a joint patrol over the Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea, and northern part of the Pacific Ocean.

As ChatGPT prepares for iPhone iOS integration, it just failed one of Apple's key pillars — privacy:
Apple's new Apple Intelligence, ChatGPT, has been hit by a security issue that could potentially access conversations stored on Mac, iPhone, and iPad stored in plain text. The issue was discovered by developer Pedro José Pereira Vieito, who was curious about OpenAI's decision to opt out of using Apple's app sandbox protections on macOS. The problem was resolved quickly and OpenAI has now released an update to encrypt these chats. This issue is a significant setback for Apple, which has recently signed a deal to bring its AI LLM to all of its best iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

Chinese-US tensions ramp up after Xi halts nuclear arms talks:
China has halted arms control and nuclear proliferation talks with the US, blaming the suspension on US arms sales to Taiwan. This has been a longstanding dispute between China and Taiwan, with China claiming that Taiwan is part of its territory and threatening to attack it if it doesn't relinquish control. The US State Department described the situation as "unfortunate," while China's approach to engage in arms control undermines strategic stability and increases the risk of arms race dynamics. The International Crisis Group suggested that this decision is unlikely to affect US support of Taiwan. The upcoming US elections in November will determine the future of future talks.

‘Strawberry’: OpenAI developing new reasoning technology:
OpenAI is working on a new approach to its artificial intelligence (AI) models, named “Strawberry’s), cod-named as a project named after Q*, aimed at enabling the company’�s AI to generate answers to queries and plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform deep research. The project is described as a work in progress by a source familiar with the company and internal documentation reviewed by Reuters. The company hopes the innovation will significantly improve its AI models’ reasoning capabilities. The Strawberry project, formerly known as Q*,, involves a specialized way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets. Researchers believe that reasoning is crucial for AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence, while large language models can already handle dense texts and write elegant prose faster than any human.

Nvidia beats U.S. restrictions to sell £9bn of chips to China:
US chip manufacturer Nvidia is set to sell over £9bn worth of chips in China this year, despite ongoing restrictions from the US regarding semiconductor exports. The company is expected to deliver more than a million of its new graphics processing chips to the region in 2024, almost doubling the amount its rival Huawei is expected selling. Each chip costs between £9,400 and £10,000, suggesting that Nvidia is likely to generate more than £9.4bn in sales. Despite these restrictions, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has defended the strong demand, stating that it is so strong that it will not stop. The firm, which designs chips used in artificial intelligence, is now worth more than the entire FTSE 100 and is the world's third most valuable company behind Microsoft and Apple.

US Reveals Expansive Arctic Strategy to Counter Russian-Chinese Influence:
The US has introduced its 2024 Arctic Strategy, which aims to enhance surveillance, intelligence capabilities, and greater cooperation with allies to counter Russian and Chinese exploitation in the Arctic. The strategy is concerned about melting ice due to climate change, making the region more accessible to adversaries. It advocates expanding military surveillance and intelligence capabilities to the Arctic, including more ground-based and space-based sensors and long-range radar to detect activities by adversaries. The inclusion of Sweden and Finland into NATO is seen as an advantage, with plans for joint exercises and cooperation to counter Russia and Chinese activities. Despite downplaying the threat's immediacy, Pentagon officials anticipate deeper Russo-Chinese military collaboration due to China's interests in the region and its ambitions to influence Arctic governance.

S&P 500 falls nearly 2% for worst week since mid-April (NYSEARCA:SPY):
The S&P 500 (SP500) fell nearly 2% for the week, marking its worst week since mid-April and is now down 2.90% from its all-time intraday high of 5,669.67 points. The primary driver of this week's loss was a continued rotation out of technology stocks due to a soft consumer inflation report. This shift has led investors to shift towards defensive and value sectors and small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 (RTY) also climbed 1.50%. Despite this, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid noted that the Nasdaq Composite (COMP:IND) lost 3.65% from Monday to Friday, but is still up 18.09% YTD. The S&T 500 equal weight index and its accompanying Invesco ETF (RSP) saw a smaller decline of 0.09%.

A Ukrainian minister says she's frustrated by the West's inability to adapt its weapons to Russian tactics: report:
Ukraine's minister of strategic industries, Anna Gvozdiar, has expressed frustration over the lack of adaptation of weapons sent to Ukraine from the West that have seen limited or even fallen by the wayside as Russian forces adapt their tactics. Excalibur artillery rounds, which was once hugely effective in Ukraine, had been all but abandoned by spring due to Russian advances. US-made HIMARS missiles, and Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bombs, have also seen their effectiveness waning. Despite these concerns, there is little incentive for US manufacturers to adapt their weapons to this rapidly changing battlefield. Russia has developed increasingly sophisticated jamming methods during its invasion of Ukraine, which far exceeds current capabilities of the US. The problem is compounded by the piecemeal manner of weapon systems being delivered to Ukraine. Some weapon systems are still proving their worth, but Russia is expected to adapt to these changes.

OpenAI Whistleblowers Allege NDAs Discourage Safety Concerns:
OpenAI (OpenAI) is facing scrutiny over its non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) which it requires employees to sign. The whistleblowers allege that these policies discourage workers from expressing safety concerns about advanced AI technologies. They have written to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, urging the agency to enforce rules protecting employees who report issues to oversight bodies. Senator Chuck Grassley's office supported the whistleblowers' appeal for transparency, stating NDAs must not curb protected communications. OpenAI responded that its NDAs respect legal protections for whistleblowers while safeguarding commercial interests, but has since revised policies following similar criticisms. The complaint highlights the need for greater transparency as AI's influence grows, with scrutiny crucial to maximizing its benefits while mitigating potential downsides.

S&P 500's tech dominance sparks calls for portfolio diversification:
The gap in returns between the S&P 500 and its equal-weighted counterpart is at its highest in 15 years, raising concerns about the potential for a pullback in major indexes due to high valuations and high expectations. This has led to the need for diversification beyond megacap stocks such as Microsoft and Nvidia. The spread between total returns widened to 10.21% in the first half of the year, the most since 2009. Despite this, market participants are finding value in broadening their portfolio by focusing on cheaper sectors. However, many expect the gap between the two indexes to narrow, as any interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve could boost small- and mid-cap stocks.

Global IT Outage Hit 1 In 4 Fortune 500 Companies, Losses Pegged At $5.4 Billion:
A global IT outage last Friday has affected one in four Fortune 500 companies, leading to an estimated collective loss of $5.4 billion, according to a report by cyber insurer Parametrix.

NVIDIA poised for $12 billion AI chip sales in China despite US export controls:
NVIDIA Corp is expected to sell $12 billion worth of its AI chips in China this year, despite US export controls. This achievement marks a significant increase from its previous sales figures. The US government implemented a ban on exporting advanced NVIDIA chips to China in 2022, which was tightened further in the previous year. NVIDIA developed the H20 chip, designed to comply with US restrictions, which has resulted in more than one million shipments of H20 chips to Chinese customers. This is almost double as many as Huawei's rival product, Ascend 910B, highlighting NVIDIA's dominant position in the Chinese AI chip market. This significant revenue increase reflects NVIDIA's resilience and strategic agility in overcoming export restrictions. The significant revenue boost is expected for the company's overall financial health and market positioning.

The Treasury Department warns that the US will continue to impose costs on those who facilitate Iran's ability to produce these weapons. These sanctions are part of a wider effort by the Treasury and State Department to target actors supporting Iran's missile and UAV programs.

OpenAI launches advanced voice mode this fall after delayed rollout:
OpenAI is set to launch its new voice mode feature for ChatGPT Plus subscribers in the fall. The premium feature, which allows employees to interrupt and ask the chatbot to tell a story in various ways, is more fun and exciting than the current voice mode. The new model does not need to convert speech to text and back again, leading to lower latency interactions. However, the launch was delayed due to concerns over the voice mode's similarity to Scarlett Johansson. The company has added filters to recognise and block requests for music or copyrighted audio. Despite this, the new model will only use four preset voices made with voice actors.

US says it has raised concerns with India about its ties with Russia TV18:
The United States has raised concerns with India about its relationship with Russia, following the country's invasion of Ukraine. This comes after a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which India has resisted, citing its longstanding ties with Russia and its economic needs. The US State Department has urged India and any other countries to respect the U.N. Charter and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia has been India's largest weapons supplier since Soviet Union days, but the Ukraine war has limited its ability to supply munitions and spares. Washington has been trying to woo India in recent years, viewing it as a counter to China in the Asia-Pacific.

Supply chain problems could spike costs for Long Island consumers even more this year:
The supply chain issues could increase costs for Long Island consumers by even more this year due to global shipping disruptions, including low water levels at the Panama Canal, rebel attacks on ships in the Red Sea, and unrest in the Philippines that is forcing cargo ships bound for the US from Southeast Asia to navigate the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, adding up to two weeks of travel time. A potential labor strike by tens of thousands of dockworkers on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S. could occur this fall amid union negotiations over concerns about automation. The cost of imported goods is expected to rise significantly, potentially increasing by up to 25 to 30%. Major retailers such as Target and Walmart may need to make key decisions regarding frontloading shipments for the holiday season or waiting to see how international events progress through summer and fall. The price to ship a 40-foot container overseas on major world routes on Thursday was $5,868, a more than 300% increase from 2019, according to Drewry's, a maritime industry research and consulting firm. The shipping industry CEO, Vincent Clerck, warned that these challenges are not something that should be taken lightly.

US asks Moscow to free jailed Russian-American journalist Kurmasheva:
The US Embassy in Moscow has called on Russia to free Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), who was jailed last week for spreading false information about the Russian army. This comes as another court in Russia also jails US reporter Evan Gershkovich for 16 years. Kurasheva was initially detained in June while trying to fly out of Russia and later accused of a minor transgression before Russian investigators opened a criminal case accusing her of spreading false info about the military. Her husband, Pavel Butorin, who also works for RFE-RL, said her trial was related to a book she had edited titled "Saying No to War". The US Embassy Moscow has expressed disappointment that Russian authorities have not granted it consular access to Kurmascheva so far.

Apollo's chief economist calls the S&P 500 'vulnerable' as it hovers just below all time high of 5,523:
The S&P 500 is near its all-time high of 5,523, with just a handful of stocks contributing to the record-breaking gains. The top 10 companies in the index now make up 35% of the market cap and 23% of earnings, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk. This disparity is making the S.P 500 look more vulnerable than it has been in decades. The appreciation of the Magnificent Seven, which includes tech giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, accounted for half of the total gains last year. Paul Dietrich, B Riley Wealth Management’s chief investment strategist, has warned investors to be cautious in the current market environment and highlighted several out-of-whack metrics suggesting that stocks are overvalued. He also highlighted the high price-to-earnings ratio for the S-P 500 and historically low dividend yield.

Software supply chain attacks are soaring – and security leaders are sluggish to react:
Research from Checkmarx has revealed that nearly two-thirds of large organizations globally were hit by software supply chain attacks in the past two years, according to the report. The report surveyed 900 application security professionals from the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with 63% of them having been the victim of such an attack within the past year, and 18% were hit in the last year. Over half of respondents’ organizational applications contain open source code packages. However, progress in this area of security is being slow, with only 7% of respondents saying they have proper security tools in place. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued new guidance on software supply chains risks, advising developers to download open source as source code rather than pre-compiled libraries or binaries and check for recent updates on newly downloaded source-code.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Ltd has attributed the recent fuel queues in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and other parts of the country to disruptions in the logistics chain, compounded by adverse weather conditions and flooding. The NNPC explained that a recent thunderstorm significantly disrupted the ship-to-ship transfer of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, between mother vessels and daughter vessels, leading to delays in berthing at jetties, truck load-outs, and the transportation of products to filling stations. The company also warned that loading petrol during rainstorms and lightning was impossible due to the flammable nature of petroleum products. Despite these challenges, the NNPPC assured the public that it is working with stakeholders to resolve the logistical bottlenecks and restore the seamless supply of petrol to affected areas.

US to Propose Limits on Chinese Vehicle Software in August:
The US Commerce Department is set to introduce proposed rules in August to limit the use of Chinese-made software in connected vehicles. The move aims to enhance national security by restricting key software components from adversary nations. The rules will focus on specific components and software critical to the operation and data management of connected vehicles, according to Alan Estevez, the Commerce undersecretary for industry and security. This is part of a broader effort to mitigate potential national security risks associated with Chinese vehicle imports. The Commerce Department's concern is that modern vehicles, which have extensive onboard network hardware and software capabilities, can collect and transmit vast amounts of data about their users, making them potentially targets for exploitation. The Chinese government has responded by urging the U.S. to adhere to market economy principles and fair competition.

S&P 500’s $18 Trillion Rally Is ‘Broadening Out’: Markets Wrap:
Stocks have hit all-time highs amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates, leading to a rush into riskier corners of the market. The Russell 2000 has beaten the Nasdaq 100 by almost 12 percentage points over the past four days, a feat not seen since 2011. The rise in small caps is seen as a sign of a trend of money rotating into small caps due to increased interest rates. Small firms tend to be domestically oriented and potentially benefit disproportionately if Donald Trump wins the election. The S&P 500 rose to 5,667, marking its 38th record this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.85%, the Russell 2000 gained 3.5%, notching its biggest five-day run since 2020.

Russia-based Kaspersky antivirus shuts down its US business due to sanctions — offices to close by July 20:
Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity and antivirus software company, has announced it will shut down all of its operations in the US on July 20 due to sanctions. The decision was made after 12 of the company's executives were hit with sanctions and the company’s products were banned from sale in the U.S. The US government has claimed that Kaspersky's continued operations posed a significant privacy risk due to its Russian connections. The company has reportedly laid off all of their US-based employees and is expected to affect less than 50 in the United States. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS) issued sanctions on Kaspershy in June, preventing it from conducting business in the country and individually sanctioning a dozen members of Kaspersy's board of executives and leadership.

Rise of Generative AI in Streamlining Transportation Operations:
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a significant increase in the use of Generative AI (AI), which can revolutionize transportation operations. The rise of AI technology is seen as a major step in the development of mobility, with potential applications include route optimization, which reduces travel time and fuel consumption, and minimizes operational costs and environmental impact. Unlike traditional AI systems, Generative Artificial Intelligence can generate new content, designs, or solutions based on existing data. It can also predict potential failures and maintenance needs of vehicles and infrastructure by analyzing data from sensors and historical maintenance records to generate models that forecast when and where maintenance is required. However, there are critical issues concerning data quality, integration, ethics, and talent scarcity that need to be resolved to ensure proper implementation of AI technologies. The future of AI lies in the execution of transportation operations, whether it is in routing transportation vehicles to the delivery of the right products to the right stores at the right time.

China Removes Sanctions on US Communications Company:
China has removed sanctions on Viasat Inc., a U.S. communications company, marking a rare reversal after initially targeting the firm for its proposed arms sales to Taiwan. The decision was made during a press briefing by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Earlier this year, China had imposed sanctions on four other American defence companies, which included freezing the companies’ assets in China and banning any transactions or cooperation with the firms by Chinese organizations and individuals. This action followed the State Department's approval of a potential $30 crore weapons sale to Taiwan, an island Beijing intends to take control of eventually. Viasats has multiple subsidiaries involved in business operations related to China, including a local branch of Inmarsat, a British satellite services provider acquired by the U.K. in 2023.

OpenAI ban expected to spur domestic Chinese LLM development despite short-term impact: experts:
The first day of OpenAI's API service took effect on Tuesday, marking the first time that China is excluded from the service. This move is expected to encourage Chinese companies to reduce their reliance on OpenAI and transition to domestic models. The US Department of the Treasury issued draft rules on June 22 banning or requiring notification of certain investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology sectors in China under the guise of safeguarding US national security. Despite the short-term impact on Chinese developers, some 10 domestic large model companies have announced to provide relocation services to help companies transition away from OpenAI. Despite this, other tech giants have not followed the ban. There are currently 1,328 large AI models globally, with China accounting for 36 percent, second only to the US.

China has requested far more patents than any other country in the world, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The United States came in second with nearly 6,300 patent applications in the decade through 2023. The technology, which can boost efficiency and speed up scientific discoveries but also raises concerns about jobs and workers, was linked to about 54,000 inventions in the period through 2025. Over a quarter of these inventions emerged last year, a testament to the rapid growth in the technology. The report, the first of its kind, aims to track patent applications as a possible indication of trends in artificial intelligence.

US to Restrict Some Chinese Software in Cars Next Month:
The US government is expected to introduce new restrictions on Chinese software in "connected vehicles" next month, requiring cars made in or imported to the US to adhere to data collection and storage policies that keep the information in an "allied country."

Russia relying on 'fellow Americans' to spread election disinformation, US officials say:
Russia is using unwitting Americans and commercial public relations firms in Russia to spread disinformation about the US presidential election, according to top intelligence officials. The Kremlin is using these methods to influence public opinion ahead of the 2024 election. This comes after a period of turbulence in U.S. politics, which has led Russia, Iran, and China to revise their propaganda playbook. The officials warned that while these nations have made changes, they remain the primary threat for election disinformation. Groups linked to the Kremlin are increasingly outsourcing some of the work of creating digital propaganda to Russia. The ultimate goal is to get Americans to spread Russian disinformation without questioning its origin. Officials have issued twice the number of warnings to political candidates, government leaders, election offices and others targeted by foreign groups so far in the 2024 elections compared to the 2022.

OpenAI’s 5 Levels Of “Super AI” (AGI To Outperform Human Capability):
OpenAI is reportedly tracking its progress towards building artificial general intelligence (AGI), a form of AI that can outperform humans on most tasks. The company uses a set of five levels to gauge its progress. The current level involves computers interacting in conversational language with people and working with team members. At level two, AI systems can perform basic problem-solving tasks comparable to a human with a doctorate-level education but without access to tools. Level three involves autonomous systems that can operate autonomously on a user’s behalf for several days, operating entirely on rules and processes without deviation. This is a significant leap in AI's capabilities and application. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, predicts that we will reach level five within ten years or some in the future, taking up to fifty years.

Manhattan is now a 'buyer's market' as real estate prices fall and inventory rises:
Manhattan is becoming a buyer's market as apartment prices fell and inventory rose in Q2 2024, according to reports from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. The average real estate sales price in Manhattan fell 3% to over $2 million, while the median price fell 2% to $1.2 million and prices for luxury apartments fell for the first time in over a year. The price declines are due to rising inventory of apartments for sale, which are taking longer to sell and are now more than 8,000 apartments available for sale in Manhattan, higher than the 10-year average of about 7,000. It would take 9.8 months to sell all of the apartments on the market without new listings. The falling prices and rising unsold apartments contrast to the national real estate landscape where tight supply continues to keep prices high.

Not Diamond automatically routes your query to the best LLM:
San Francisco-based startup, Not Diamond, has developed a novel LLM router, which allows enterprises to direct queries to the best possible model for their applications. The company claims this is the answer to the challenge of finding what works best for specific use cases in the rapidly evolving nature of large language models (LLMs). The router uses a ‘meta-model’ to automatically route queries between multiple models and provides cost and latency benefits. It has raised $2.3 million in initial funding from defy.vc and several leading names in the AI industry, including Google DeepMind’s chief scientist Jeff Dean, Hugging Face’�s Julien Chaumond, OpenAI’ Zack Kass, Databricks chairman Ion Stoica, Github’'s Tom Preston-Werner and Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn. The underlying tech is a “meta model’ and LLM ranking algo, which determines which LLM is best suited to respond to a given query and can train a custom router that chooses which model would be the best suited for internal evaluation.

US, Mexico tighten steel, aluminium import rules to curb China tariff evasion:
The US and Mexico have tightened import rules to combat China's excess industrial capacity, which Washington has warned could lead to a flood of unfairly priced goods. Steel product imports from Mexico will be subject to 25% US "Section 232" tariffs unless the steel is melted and poured in Mexico, the US or Canada, and aluminium imports from China, Russia, Belarus, or Iran must not contain primary aluminium that is smelt or cast in China. The new measures aim to counterbalance US tariffs on steel and aluminium by countries that ship products through Mexico. Mexico will also require importers of steel products across its borders to provide more information on the country of origin of these products. The measures come amid concerns about China's overcapacity industrial capacity flooding global markets with exports amid weak domestic demand.

RBC raises S&P 500 year-end target, but strategist says she's nervous about it:
RBC Capital Markets has increased its 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,700, up from 5,300, indicating a 19.5% gain from where the market ended in December 2023 and a 4.4% rise from June's close. However, head of global equity strategy Lori Calvasina expressed cautiousness about the increase, calling it a "nervous and jumpy increase".

The S & P 500 has risen nearly 15% year to date, largely driven by chipmaker Nvidia and a small group of other megacap tech stocks.

U.S. Plans New Rule on Foreign Chip Equipment Exports to China, Exempting Key Allies:
The United States is planning to introduce a new rule to restrict semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports to China, extending the Foreign Direct Product rule which restricts the sale of products made using American technology to certain countries.

The Commission on the National Defense Strategy stated that the security environment is at its most dangerous since World War II and that the U.S. is being outpaced by China, which is estimated to be spending at least $711 billion annually on defense compared to the nearly $900 billion annual defense budget. The commission also highlighted the need for significant change to the Pentagon's approach to combat. They called for a more robust approach to addressing security needs and for more spending on cyber defense. They also called for the defense industrial base to be more diverse and collaborative.

S&P is racking up record highs, but there’s 'defiant' behavior beneath the headline moves:
The S&P 500 (SP500)(SPY) continues to achieve record highs in 2024, with the large-cap index marking its 36th record closing high for the year by edging up 0.1% to 5,576.98. The index has also risen by 17% YTD and is on track for a seventh consecutive win. However, according to a chart from investment research firm SentimenTrader, the S.P 500 is moving one way while its stocks do the opposite. So far this year, roughly 40% of the S/P 500’s 503 components have lost ground. Major-cap tech stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and SPXU have seen significant rises.

China appeals ‘discriminatory, protectionist’ US electric car subsidies before WTO:
China has appealed against subsidies granted to the US electric vehicle industry under President Joe Biden's green plan, accusing Washington of implementing "discriminatory, protectionist" policies. The dispute was brought before the World Trade Organization in March, but China has now asked the WTO to set up a panel of experts to investigate the issue. The US law excludes products from China and other WTO members, artificially sets trade barriers and increases costs of the green energy transition. China has denied its industrial policies are unfair and has threatened retaliation to protect its companies' legal rights and interests. This comes amid ongoing disputes between Beijing and Washington over several trade issues, including customs duties, cutting-edge technologies, and a possible ban on social media site TikTok.

OpenAI and Its Gaping Security Issues:
OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT has been revealed to be storing user chats locally in plain text instead of encrypting them. This move comes after a security expert suggested that the app was storing user conversations locally, without encryption. The company responded by releasing an update that added encryption to the locally stored chats. This could increase the risk of malware attacks on other apps. A hacker reportedly accessed the company's internal messaging systems in 2023, stealing details of its AI tech designs. The New York Times reported that the hacker also gained access to internal discussions where employees discussed OpenAI's latest innovations. However, this breach was reportedly politically motivated and resulted in the termination of technical program manager Leopold Aschenbrenner. The response to these concerns was generally taciturn.

Don't chase new highs, wait for a market pullback, advises Canaccord Genuity:
Investors may not be chasing new highs in the stock market, according to an analyst for Canaccord Genuity. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at all-time highs on Monday, adding to strong gains in the first half of the year. Michael Welch, who noted the high bar for Q2 earnings, underperformance of the average stock, and potential for volatility heading into the Presidential election could provide a better opportunity for buying on a near-term pullback. The stock market's strength has been largely due to mega-cap tech stocks, with the top 10 stocks accounting for over 38% of the index's total capitalization. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is trading at a rich multiple of 24 times trailing 12-month profits, with expectations for 10.1% earnings growth in the second quarter.

US pledges US$500mil funds to boost Philippine defences amid disputes in South China Sea:
The United States has pledged US$500 million for the Philippines' military and coast guard in a significant gesture of support as it faces Chinese actions in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with their Philippine counterparts in Manila to reaffirm Washington's commitment to its oldest treaty ally in Asia. The funding is described as "unprecedented" and sends a clear message of support from the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. Congress, and the American public. The Philippines has competing claims with China in the waters to its west also known as the South C Sea, where China claims 90% of the sea. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that China's claims had no basis under international law.

US set to impose rules restricting Chinese vehicle software imports:
The US Commerce Department is set to enforce limits on some connected vehicle software made in China in August, according to a senior official from the Department of Exact Control. The key driver components of the vehicle, which manage the software and data around that car, would need to be made in an allied country. The Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo, has also hinted that the Biden administration may ban the vehicles after launching an investigation into whether Chinese vehicle imports pose national security risks. China has previously called on the US to respect the laws of the market economy and principles of fair competition.
