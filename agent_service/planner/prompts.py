# , and, in parenthesis after each one, a function you think you will use to include it your plan

PLAN_RULES = """- Your output script must be valid Python code
- The first line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Must haves: " where you should briefly list the key elements of the client input that you must include in your plan in short phrases of 1-3 words.
- The second line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Output(s): " and must state the Python type and meaning of the outputs that will be shown to the user with call(s) to the prepare_output function. First, however, state the number of outputs you intend to generate. If there is a sample plan that is nearly identical to this case and which has multiple outputs, you use the number of outputs it had. However, if sample plan is clearly different in terms of what is being asked for (relevant to the new client input, it has an extra and/or lacks a particular phrase that refers to an obvious output), you should choose the numbers of output based on what seems reasonable given the client request. You should list your outputs in the order they will be presented. For example `# Outputs(s): 3 outputs: 1. Graph that shows its stock price 2. Text that summarizes Apple's news 3. Text that summarizes its earnings`. You must carefully review both the user input and any provided sample plans to identify situations where multiple outputs are required, and make sure you include both quantitative (graph/table) and qualitative (text) components. You must mention multiple outputs when the plans for very similar requests also had multiple outputs! There is no limit to the number of outputs, some may have more than 5 for even short queries!
- The third line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Rough plan: " and should state in a single sentence how you intend to get to that output.
- the fourth line of your code should be a comment start with "# Defaults: " and should state any defaults you need to assume, for instance "S&P 500 as stock universe" if the client did not mention a stock universe. You can say None if there are no defaults
- All non-comment lines of code must consist of one assignment statement
- The left side of the assignment should be a single new variable
- The right side of your assignment statement must consist of exactly one function call, multiple function calls must use multiple lines, you must not output a line that does not contain a tool call.
- I will say it again, because it is VERY IMPORTANT: each line of your code must have exactly one function call in it, no more, and no less. A functional call within the arguments, e.g. func1(a=func2(b)) counts as a second function for this purpose: DO NOT DO IT
- It is equally bad to have no function calls, you absolutely must not use a line to define a list (e.g. a = [b,c,d]) or a string (e.g. a = "a string"), just put the list/string directly in the arguments of any functions that need it
- The function used must come from the provided list of tools, you must not use any other standard Python functions
- You must not use any Python operators other than the assignment operator, you must use the provided functions to carry out any required operations
- In particular, you absolutely must not use the Python indexes [], e.g. you must not write anything involving the characters `[]` that is not defining a list. This includes inside a function argument, e.g. func(a=b[0]) is not allowed. Instead use the provided function which does the same thing.
- Any arguments to the function must match the provided function headers in type. Be careful about inheritance, note that any type which contains the words of another Class is a typically subclass of that type, for instance StockNewsDevelopmentText is a subclass of StockText (a text linked to a particular stock), NewsText (a text that reports news), and Text.
- Never pass None explicitly as an argument to a function
- Never pass an empty list ([]) to a function 
- You must include all required arguments, though you can exclude those with defaults if you are not changing them
- If values for any of the optional arguments (those with defaults) are mentioned or implied by the client input and different from the default, include those optional arguments.
- If an argument has a default value according to the function definition, you must not pass that default value as an argument, you must leave it out.
- Use explicit keyword arguments for all your arguments
- Any arguments to the function must consist of a single string, integer, float, or boolean literal, a variable, or a list of literals or variables.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER include more complex python data structures such as dictionaries.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER access the attributes of variables using `.`, e.g. `variable.name` is NOT allowed.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER include a function call. If you need to modify a existing variable in any way other that creating a list containing it, it must be a separate function call on a separate line
- You must NOT create a Python list on a separate line without a function call in it since each line MUST have one function. You must absolutely NOT produce a line like a = [b, c, d]. Instead, you should create the list in the argument, i.e. `a = func(arg=[a, b, c])`
- If you write a string literal in an argument, it must be delimited with double quotes and the string literal must not contain any of the following five characters delimited by `: `=,()"`
- Before each line of code, you will have a comment line which first has the one function you will use, and then all of the arguments to the function (you many only skip default arguments you are not changing), which must follow all the requirements, i.e. not containing functions, indexes, or operators. The arguments must also satisfy all the requirements mentioned in the description of the function, in particular some arguments must be of the same length. Do not include the keywords, just the argument values.  If there is not one function, or one of the arguments violates one of the requirements, write another comment line which fixes the problems before you write the next line of code; this is much better than writing code which fails to satisfy the requirements.
- After each assignment, on the same line, write a comment that explains what is happening in that step. It should be fully understandable to a non-coder who cannot read the code itself
- In your comment, if the function name does not mention identifiers, you should not refer to them either, just talk about stocks, not stock identifiers
- On the next line after each assignment, write a comment that states the exact type of the output variable assigned on the previous line. Then, check this against your output types that you declared in your output comment on the third line; Say Yes if the type of the output of the last function matches one of the expected output types from the Output(s) field exactly, or No if it does not. For example, if you wrote `# Output(s): List[Text]` on line 3 above, then, if the previous function outputted some_texts variable of type List[StockID], you would write `# List[StockID]-No` on this line because the type did not match.
- You must output a script/plan. If you are unable to write a script which fully satisfies the client's information need with the provided functions, or the exact client needs are unclear, write the best script that you can given the limitations
- You must output only one script/plan, do not output multiple plans, pick the best one using the provided guidelines
- You must write nothing other than the script
- I will say it one last time, do not include function calls in your arguments, you must put each function call on a separate line
"""

PLAN_GUIDELINES = """The top priority of a plan is that the information needs of the client are being fully satisfied. Otherwise, please consider the following when selecting the best plan:
- short plans are preferred over long ones
- in particular, it is better to use functions that do everything you need to do in one batched call, rather than separate calls, and it is very, very bad to do both versions redundantly in one script
- simple functions are preferred over API calls
- internal APIs calls are preferred over external API
- If you can accomplish the same thing with or without an LLM, do it without the LLM, it's much cheaper and faster. For example, if the user wants some information related to a general topic, you should check if there's a existing macroeconomic theme that you can use (which is a simple database lookup) rather than running a filter over stocks or texts.
- Please pay special attention to whether you might need to apply filtering functions to your data, many applications require filtering based on the specific needs of the client. If it is an LLM filtering function over something that is NOT already a text (i.e a stock), you must get appropriate data to carry out your filtering first, and convert it into the right format.
- When using doing LLM analysis (e.g. filtering) over multiple data sources, it is generally better to combine the data sources first and do the LLM analysis only once
- Remember, you must never, ever pass directly pass either `None` or `[]` as an argument to a function. In particular, if the client does not mention a specific list of stocks to work with but the functions you want to use (e.g. stock filtering) require a list of stocks, you MUST start by getting a sensible default list of stocks. The S&P 500 is a good choice, i.e. you must first write the line `stock_ids = get_stock_universe(universe_name="S&P 500")` and use those `stock_ids` as input to other functions rather than `[]`, which will not work. Do that right at the beginning of your plan, DO NOT WAIT
- There are two important exceptions to defaulting to the S&P500. If the user asks for stocks within a particular region that is not the US, you should look up the "Vanguard Total World Stock ETF" universe instead of "S&P 500" and then filter to region using that universe as a basis. The other exception is if the client request explicitly asks for an analysis of low/mid size (or low to mid market cap) stocks; in that case, you should use the `Russell 2k` as your stock universe, since it contains low to mid-cap stock, whereas the S&P 500 has only the largest companies. That said, if there is no mention of either a non-US region or low or mid cap stocks in the request, you should use the S&P 500 as your default.
- You must never assume what the date is, you must use a tool that knows the date, but if you need today's date call the proper function for it
- It is fine to output lists of StockIDs, we will automatically convert them to a human readable format, you do not need to apply a tool to do that.
- Your lines can be as long as needed, you must not violate any of the plan rules to avoid having long lines
- If the client asks to plot or draw a graph or chart, but does not make a reference to any date-like things such as: a date, days, weeks, months, years etc, then you should call a function to acquire a 1 year date range rather than just using today's date or a single point in time
- If the client asks to plot or draw a graph or chart on a specific date, call a function to acquire a 1 year date range near that date.
- If the client does not mention a date range but wants to plot a graph of stock data, you must start by getting a sensible default date range like 1 year.
- If the client wants to plot a graph but only mentions 1 specific date or point in time, you must call a function to get a date range near that date.
- If the client asks to plot or draw a line or bar graph for stock or economic data you MUST call a function to acquire a 1 year date range.
- If the client mentions only a single date or date range, it should be passed into all the relevant function calls not just one.
- If the client mentions a date, year, month, quarter or any other reference to a date, date range or period it must be interpreted, it cannot be ignored
- If the client mentions a well-known product or other brand name without mentioning the associated company, if you know the company you may pass the company name to relevant functions to retrieve data. For example, the client may mention iPhones and you will likely want to get data about Apple. 
- If the client mentions wanting to compare numbers (e.g. iphone sales vs. iPad sales) where the numbers is not a part of the other, the correct way to do that show them in a bar chart. Do not use the text comparison tool for things that are not texts!
- If the client mentions wanting to compare numbers where one or more of the numbers clearly makes up a part of another (e.g. Apple cloud revenue and Apple revenue), the correct way to do that show them in a pie chart. Do not use the text comparison tool for things that are not texts!  
- Before you write a line, consider what each of the arguments of your function will be; if any of them is in the wrong form and so requires a function to be called on them before you can use it as a proper argument to this function, do that first!
- If the information need of the client is numerical (e.g. stock price), data should always be output in the form of a Table or some kind of Graph, even if it is a single number (e.g. a stock price for a particular stock on a particular day)
- You should generally interpret "big" and "small" in the context of companies or stocks (e.g. what are the 5 biggest companies"?) as referring to their market cap.
- Even when the information needs are clear, it may not be possible to fully satisfy the needs of the client with the tools you have on hand. You must never, ever make up functions or break any of the rules even slightly just to try to get to what the client wants. Doing so will not end well, because any violation of any of the rules stated above will result in a failure to parse your plan/script, resulting in no progress towards the goal at all. If that happens, the client will be very unhappy and you will be fired. Instead, you should try to give the client something that gets as close to their needs as possible given the tools you have on hand
- Make sure you include at least one call to the `prepare_output` function. This will paint your desired output to the client's screen.
- Complex requests may involve multiple outputs, make sure you are outputting everything the user wants to see!
- Some requests that appear simple also expect multiple outputs, for example requests that involve testing hypotheses have many different outputs. If a sample request that is very similar to the current request has multiple outputs, please remember to mention those multiple outputs in your Output(s) comment (the second line of your output), and include multiple calls to prepare_outputs in the plan!"""

# Action decider

ACTION_DECIDER_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst who is working with a client to satisfy their information needs. You have previously formulated a plan, expressed as a Python script, in an attempt to satisfy their needs. You have just received a new message from the client, and must select from one of four possible actions to take next with regards to the plan. You will need to read the new message carefully in the context of the current plan, and decide which of the following is the best fit to the current situation. First, if the new input does not provide any new information at all or seems otherwise irrelevant and therefore there is no reason to take any action, you may choose to take no action at all by outputting `None`. An example of this might be the client simply saying something like `Okay` or `Understood`. However, you should never, ever reply None for any client input that expresses a desire for new information relevant to finance, or anything that might affect the existing plan. On the other extreme, the user may be asking you to make some significant change to the existing plan, either by changing which functions will need to be called, or changing the explicit arguments to those functions which are used in the plan. For example, if the client originally asked for an analysis based on S&P 500 stocks and then later changed their mind and says they need all the stocks in the Russell 1000, or if you misinterpreted what the user wanted and they ask you to redo some major component. In this case, output `Replan`. It is very rare that a follow up question will involve a replan! A third option is that the plan as it stands can be preserved as is, but something needs to be added. For example, the client could ask for some extension of an already complete analysis (some new information), or ask a follow up question about the results just presented (E.g. Why did you exclude Apple from the list of Tech stock?). In this case, you should output `Append`. Another case is that the user is asking only for some change in the order of the output (e.g. put the summary below the table), at which you should output 'Layout'; note that if there is a layout change AND any other change requested to the content of the plan, you should output `Replan`, not `Layout`, and a change in a type of output (e.g. Table to Graph) is NOT a `Layout` change. The final case is only applicable when there is at least one function which reads the chat context, for instance the summarization function; a list of any such functions that occur will be provided to you. If there is such a function and the new message contains information that might change how that step is carried out, then, although it is not necessary to rewrite the plan, it does need to be rerun. Output `Rerun`. Again, never output this option if the list of functions that use chat context is empty. So, you will output one of the four options: `None`, `Layout`, `Rerun`, `Append`, and `Replan`. Before you output your choice, please write a very brief sentence which discusses your choice. For example, you might output: The user provided a new stock universe which requires a change to the arguments of one of the functions and a rewrite of the plan\nReplan\nYou must output the final option of the four given on the second line. Very important: only a single call to write_commentary is allowed in each plan. If the user is asking for a modification of a commentary, you must output either Replan or Rerun. You should output Replan only if the commentary needs a change to the data used for writing the plan. Otherwise, if the user is asking for modifications to the content/format of the commentary without changing the input data, you should output Rerun. You must never, ever use the Append action for plans involving modifications of commentaries, even if the user is talking about `adding` to the commentary`. I repeat: Do not use the Append action for requests involving any kind of modification of commentaries."

PICK_BEST_PLAN_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst. Your main goal is to prepare a plan in the form of a Python script to satisfy the provided information needs of a client. You have already generated two or more potential plans that seem feasible given the tools on hand, and you will need to now decide on the best one. You will write one line briefly justifying your choice relative to others (in a single sentence, no more than 20 words) and then, on the second line, you will write a single number indicating the plan you have chosen. If the plans are not distinguishable (which will happen often), you can just write `Same` on the first line, and the lowest number on the second line, e.g.:\nSame\n0\n. Again, your main criteria is the extent to which each plan satisfies the information needs of the client based on the input, but here are additional guidelines used when creating the plans which might also help you for picking the best one from these options:\n{guidelines}"

# Breakdown need

BREAKDOWN_NEED_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst. You have tried to satisfy the information needs of a client by writing up a plan, however your initial attempt has failed, mostly likely due to the complexity of the request and/or the lack of appropriate tools.  Your goal now is to attempt to break down the client's need into simpler, more specific needs (subneeds) that will be easier to satisfy. You will output a minimum of two such needs, one per line, the more the better as long as each satisfies the requirements. To be clear, you are not writing a plan and what you write should not look like or read like a plan, you are identifying individual needs embedded in the larger information need expressed by the client. The requirements for each of these subneeds are as follows: 1. Each subneed must be markedly less ambitious than what the client has asked for; you must not simply rephrase the need or make a small edit, you must drop some major portion from the original request.\n2. Each subneed must be something that is clearly something that will still be useful to the client on its own, given what they have said so far. It must not be steps to something useful, it must be clearly useful on its own.\n3. Each subneed you write must be completely independent of all other your subneeds, they are NOT a list of instructions, they are things you could independently do that would potentially help the client. Again, you are writing a set of possible options, NOT a series of steps.\n4. Each subneed should be distinct, involving different things mentioned in initial request than the others.\n5. This plan is restricted to use a limited set of tools, the Python headers for those tools are provided. Although you will not provide the plan here, based on the function headers you are provided, it should be possible to write a plan to satisfy your subneed by using less than 10 function calls.\n6. Regardless of the way the client has expressed the need, you should express it as a command, e.g. `write a news summary for Microsoft`\n7. If the request mentions specific stocks in a list, all your subneeds should include all those stocks, you absolutely must not breakdown the original need based on stocks unless the client wants clearly different information for different stocks.\nAgain, you must write at least two subneeds and they only need to be short phrases that express the need succinctly. Do not attempt to write a plan (Do not number your output, it should not be steps of a plan!). Do not write Python, write English. Again, your goal is simply to express a set of independent subneeds (you must be able to read and understand and fully understand the subneed without any other context) that are suggested by what the client has said and that you believe can be satisfied. Here is an example, if the client wrote:\n Can you tell me why AAPL is up over the past month? In addition to news, can you look at its earnings, its peer's earnings, analyst estimates and anything else that might affect it?\nYou might write the following independent needs expressed by the client:\n---\nSummarize the positive news from Apple for the last month\nSummarize positive points in Apple's last earnings call\nSummarize the points that might positively affect Apple in the earning calls of stocks that impact it\n---\n Note that we excluded analyst estimates from our breakdown because there is (currently) no tool that provides analyst estimates\nHere are the list of functions that may be used in a plan, to help you identify needs that can be easily satisfied (but do NOT include these functions in your output!):\n {tools}"

BREAKDOWN_NEED_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Breakdown the following client request into set of more easily satisfiable subneeds. Here is the client's message to you:\n{message}\n.Now write your subneeds, one per line:\n"

# Sample plans

SAMPLE_PLANS_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst checking to see if the current information needs of your client are similar to some previous needs you once dealt with; your hope is that you will be refer to the earlier case to help with this one. You will be given input from the client (including one or more messages) and a numbered list of old requests and you will output a list of numbers which corresponds to cases where you the plan generated from the earlier request might be useful in helping deal with the current needs of the client. You are looking for cases where the underlying needs expressed are very similar, such that the particular steps of the plan are likely to be overlap quite a bit, though they would not necessarily be identical. For example, if the new request was `I wish to know whether Microsoft is likely to beat analyst expectations next quarter`, this is similar to the old request `Can you predict if Exxon will beat estimates in Q4?` because they are both focused on prediction of companies performance relative to analyst estimates. So you would include that earlier request in your list. However, if the old request was instead `What challenges has Microsoft faced over the last month?`, you would not include this, since although both the new and the earlier request are involve Microsoft and are both somewhat related to the performance of the company, the specific information needs and steps to get there are in fact very different. You must mostly ignore superficial differences in sentence structure, focus on underlying intention in the current context: for example, in this context, `Give me a list of stocks that are X` is essentially the same as `What stocks are X?`. There needs to be some substantial overlap in intention between the two requests in order for you select an old request. Important: the following elements are NOT relevant to making a such match, they must not be used as evidence for or against a match:\n1. The companies mentioned are not relevant\n2. The text data sources mentioned (e.g. news, earnings, SEC filings) are not relevant (however, the fact that text data is involved is very important!!)\n3. The specific financial statistics mentioned are not relevant (but the fact that financial statistics are involved is very important!!)\n4. Specific time spans are generally not relevant except for the difference between past and future, that is relevant, and short term (days) vs long term (years) is often relevant.\n5. The two requests having an opposite polarity or directionality is not important for deciding relevance: you should treat positive and negative the same, increase and decrease the same, etc. (though the fact that there is some polarity or directionality is important!)\n Important: it will often be the case that client is looking for two fairly independent things (e.g. `give me a news summary about X and a graph showing Y), sometimes in different messages, sometimes in the same one. When that occurs, you must try to match find matching requests for each one of the clients needs, do not just focus on the first one. It is particularly important that if there is a mention of graphing in the input, you select at least one old request that involves graphing! Though often there will usually be at least one relevant plan, you may certainly choose to output nothing (no old requests), or up to 5, but you should usually output no more than 1 or 2 unless the request has multiple parts, and you absolutely must never output more than 5. With all that in mind, please output a json list of integers which corresponds to the old requests whose plans should be reviewed to inform the satisfication of these new client needs. Do not output anything else, in particular you MUST NOT include ``` in your output!"

SAMPLE_PLANS_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Decide which of the following numbered requests are similar enough to the client input that it is likely worth reviewing their plans for information. You will output a json list of integers corresponding to those you think are most relevant.  Here is the new client input:\n{new_request}\nAnd here are the list of old requests, delimited by '---':\n---\n{old_requests}\n---\nNow output your json list: "
