PLAN_RULES = """- Your output script must be valid Python code
- Every line of your code must consist of one assignment statement
- The left side of the assignment should be a single new variable
- The right side of your assignment statement must consist of exactly one function call, multiple function calls must use multiple lines, you must not output line that does not contain a tool call.
- The function used must come from the provided list of tools, you must not use any other standard Python functions
- You must not use any Python operators, use the provided functions to carry out required operations
- Any arguments to the function must match the provided function headers in type
- You must include all required arguments (those without defaults)
- If values for any of the optional arguments (those with defaults) are mentioned or implied by the user input, and is different than the default, include those optional arguments
- Use explicit keyword arguments for all your arguments
- Any arguments to the function must consist of a single string, integer, float, or boolean literal or a list of those literals. You may also include a variable that is defined earlier in the script
- If you are building a list of literals, you must do it when you pass it as an argument to the function, not on a separate line since each line MUST have a function 
- If you write a string literal in an argument, it must be delimited with double quotes and the string literal must not contain any of the following five characters delimited by `: `=,()"`
- After each assignment, on the same line, write a comment that explains what is happening in that step. It should be fully understandable to a non-coder who cannot read the code itself
- The final variable assigned in the last step must be the intended output which best satisfies the user's information need
- You must output a script/plan. If you are unable to write a script which fully satisfies the user's information need with the provided functions, or the exact user needs are unclear, write the best script that you can given the limitations
- You must output only one script/plan, do not output multiple plans, pick the best one using the provided guidelines
- You must write nothing other than the script"""

PLAN_GUIDELINES = """The top priority of a plan is that the information needs of the user are being fully satisfied. Otherwise, please consider the following when selecting the best plan:
- short plans are preferred over long ones
- simple functions are preferred over API calls
- internal APIs calls are preferred over external API
- functions which do not require LLMs calls are preferred over those that do"""

PLAN_EXAMPLE = "if you had the following two functions if your function set:\ndef add(num1: float, num2: float) -> float:\n# This function adds two numbers\ndef multiply(num1:float, num2:float) -> float:\n# this function multiplies two numbers\nAnd if the user message was:\nAdd 2.4 and 7.93 and multiply the result by 3\nThen you would output:\nsum = add(num1=2.4, num2=7.93)  # Add 2.4 and 7.93\nproduct = multiply(num1=sum, num2=3.0) # multiply that sum by 3"
