PLAN_RULES = """- Your output script must be valid Python code
- The first line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Must haves: " where you should briefly list the key elements of the client input that you must include in your plan in short phrases of 1-3 words.
- The second line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Output(s): " and must state the Python type and meaning of the outputs that will be shown to the user with call(s) to the prepare_output function. First, however, state the number of outputs you intend to generate. If there is a sample plan that is nearly identical to this case and which has multiple outputs, you use the number of outputs it had. However, if sample plan is clearly different in terms of what is being asked for (relevant to the new client input, it has an extra and/or lacks a particular phrase that refers to an obvious output), you should choose the numbers of output based on what seems reasonable given the client request. You should list your outputs in the order they will be presented. For example `# Outputs(s): 3 outputs: 1. Graph that shows its stock price (none) 2. Text that summarizes Apple's news (none) 3. Text that summarizes its earnings (none)`. You must carefully review both the user input and any provided sample plans to identify situations where multiple outputs are required, and make sure you include both quantitative (graph/table) and qualitative (text) components. You must mention multiple outputs when the plans for very similar requests also had multiple outputs! There is no limit to the number of outputs, many may have more than 5 for even short queries, and some may have more than 10! Please pay special attention to the case where the client asks for a summary or summaries for a single stock involving multiple topics: it is critical that each and every one of those topics must in fact be a separate call to summarize_texts with a separate output, you must enumerate each and every one of those outputs now! For example, 'summarize Microsoft's earnings call and SEC filings, discussing anything relevant to revenue, capital allocation, and new initiatives', you must have three outputs focused on the three main topics mentioned: a revenue summary, a capital allocation summary, and a new initiatives summary; it is always better to break up summaries by topic rather than by souce document type if it is at all ambiguous! However, when doing summaries with lists of stocks (including StockGroups) or ideas, you will generally only add a single summary encompassing all related topics to the relevant list and output the list exactly once, even when multiple topics are requested (provided they are related). If one of the outputs is needed to create another (i.e. there is a dependency between outputs), you must state this explicitly now; at the end of the explanation for each group, write (none) if the output is not dependent on another output, or (dependent on N, X) where N is the output number if it does. For instance, if your first output is a list of recommended stocks (which cannot be passed as an argument to a summarize text function!), and then the second output is a discussion of commonalities of those stocks, you would write ` # Output(s): 2 outputs 1. List of recommended stocks (none) 2. Summary of commonalities among list of recommended stocks (dependent on 1) If you say 1 affects 2, your plan MUST implement a connection between the two outputs, follow the sample plan if applicable!
- The third line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Rough plan: " and should state in a single sentence how you intend to get to that output.
- the fourth line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Defaults: " and should state any defaults you need to assume, for instance "S&P 500 as stock universe" if you are doing a stock filter but the client did not mention a specific universe. Please think carefully about whether there will be any stock filtering in your plan (any tool that starts with 'filter' in the name) and whether or not a stock universe is mentioned by the client; if there is stock filtering involved but no stock universe mentioned, you MUST mention a default universe here. However, please look carefully for references to non-US regions and/or non-US stocks that might alter the best choice for default universe. You can say None if there are no defaults.
- the fifth line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Products: " and identify any specific products mentioned in the client input, and if so, you should provide the name of the company that produces them in parenthesis beside them (if there are no product, just write None)
- the sixth line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Text types:", and if there are particular kind of texts mentioned by the user that they want to use in their analysis (e.g. news developments/articles, SEC filings like 10-K/Q, 8-K, earnings calls), you must state them. If there are text types after you write them, you must write "I will not use the get_default_text_data_for_companies tool", and follow your instuctions. Otherwise, write None.
- All non-comment lines of code must consist of one assignment statement
- The left side of the assignment should be a single new variable
- The right side of your assignment statement must consist of exactly one function call, multiple function calls must use multiple lines, you must not output a line that does not contain a tool call.
- I will say it again, because it is VERY IMPORTANT: each line of your code must have exactly one function call in it, no more, and no less. A functional call within the arguments, e.g. func1(a=func2(b)) counts as a second function for this purpose: DO NOT DO IT
- It is equally bad to have no function calls, you absolutely must not use a line to define a list (e.g. a = [b,c,d]) or a string (e.g. a = "a string"), just put the list/string directly in the arguments of any functions that need it
- Defining any list variable (e.g. a = [b,c,d]) or any string variable (e.g. a = "a string") is absolutely forbidden! Just put the list/string directly in the arguments of any functions that need them. 
- The function used must come from the provided list of tools, you must not use any other standard Python functions
- You must not use any Python operators other than the assignment operator, you must use the provided functions to carry out any required operations
- In particular, you absolutely must not use the Python indexes [], e.g. you must not write anything involving the characters `[]` that is not defining a list. This includes inside a function argument, e.g. func(a=b[0]) is not allowed. Instead use the provided function which does the same thing.
- Any arguments to the function must match the provided function headers in type. Be careful about inheritance, note that any type which contains the words of another Class is a typically subclass of that type, for instance StockNewsDevelopmentText is a subclass of StockText (a text linked to a particular stock), NewsText (a text that reports news), and Text.
- Never pass None explicitly as an argument to a function
- Never use `for` loops in your code, instead use one of the per_X tools that carries out iterative processing, or, if you're sure none of those tools apply and you have a small fixed set of items to iterate over, just repeat the code.
- Never pass an empty list ([]) as a function argument. All your arguments which are lists must have at least one element.
- You must include all required arguments, though you can exclude those with defaults if you are not changing them
- If values for any of the optional arguments (those with defaults) are mentioned or implied by the client input and different from the default, include those optional arguments.
- If an argument has a default value according to the function definition, you must not pass that default value as an argument, you must leave it out.
- Use explicit keyword arguments for all your arguments
- Any arguments to the function must consist of a single string, integer, float, or boolean literal, a variable, or a list of literals or variables.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER include more complex python data structures such as dictionaries.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER access the attributes of variables using `.`, e.g. `variable.name` is NOT allowed.
- In your arguments, you must NEVER include a function call. If you need to modify a existing variable in any way other that creating a list containing it, it must be a separate function call on a separate line
- You must NOT create a Python list on a separate line without a function call in it since each line MUST have one function. You must absolutely NOT produce a line like a = [b, c, d]. Instead, you should create the list in the argument, i.e. `a = func(arg=[a, b, c])`
- If you write a string literal in an argument, by itself or inside a list, it must be delimited with double quotes and the string literal must NOT contain either double quotes, i.e. `"` or the equals signs, i.e. `=`. If either of these characters appear in a string literal argument to a function, the line will not parse and you will be fired. Note that this includes `>=` and `<=`, you should convert any use of these inequalities to the English phrases `greater than or equal` or `less than or equal`.
{rule_complement}
- Each line of code must be on a single line no matter how long it is, do not format lines of code with newlines.
- You must output a script/plan. If you are unable to write a script which fully satisfies the client's information need with the provided functions, or the exact client needs are unclear, write the best script that you can given the limitations
- You must output only one script/plan, do not output multiple plans, pick the best one using the provided guidelines
- You must write nothing other than the script
- I will remind you the most important rules for the last time: 
    1) DO NOT include function/tool calls inside other function's arguments (e.g. func1(a=func2(b)) is forbidden)
    2) DO NOT assign/define a list or a string to a variable in a new line (e.g. a = [b,c,d] or a = "a string" are forbidden)
    3) DO NOT use `for` loops in your code."""

- Before each line of code, you will have a comment line which first has the one function you will use, and then all of the arguments to the function (you many only skip default arguments you are not changing), which must follow all the requirements, i.e. not containing functions, indexes, or operators. In particular, please confirm that your string arguments do not contain any disallowed characters, please look carefully for equal signs! The arguments must also satisfy all the requirements mentioned in the description of the function, in particular. You must never, ever have a function name in your arguments, if you are writing a function name as an argument, stop immediately and start a new line which calls that function directly, it is absolutely essential that there is only one function name in each line of code you write! If the function generates an output matching one of the outputs in the list at the top of your code and the description of that output mentions a dependency, put an asterisk (*) next to the argument that is or contains the data that the output for the next line of code depends on. For each time you wrote `dependent on` in your Output(s) header, you must have at least one asterisk (e.g. `combined_texts*`) That asterisk should appear only here, not in the actual function arguments. If there is not one function, or one of the arguments violates one of the requirements, or there is a dependency with an earlier tool output but you have failed to include an argument that realizes that dependency (no asterisk on at least one argument), stop immediately and write another comment line which fixes the problems before you write the next line of code; this is much better than writing code which fails to satisfy the requirements. 
- After each assignment, on the same line, write a comment that explains what is happening in that step. It should be fully understandable to a non-coder who cannot read the code itself. Every single line of code must have a comment, if any comment is missing the code will not parse. Even prepare_output tools need comments, do not forget!
- In your comment, if the function name does not mention identifiers, you should not refer to them either, just talk about stocks, not stock identifiers
- On the next line after each assignment, write a comment that states the exact type of the output variable assigned on the previous line. Then, check this against your outputs that you declared in your output comment on the third line; If it is clearly one of those outputs, write the number of that output. For example, if you wrote `# Output(s): 1. List of ML news texts` on line 3 above, then, if the previous function outputted some stocks of type List[StockID], you would write `# List[StockID]-No` on this line because the type did not match. It must be an exact match for what you are looking for, and not just a successful intermediate step. However, if it does match, write the output number, and then check to see if another output depends on that output number. If not, output N-none, else output `N-affects-M-*tool*', where N is output number for the current assignment, and M is an output that it affects (i.e. in your Output comment, there must be an item M. ... (dependent on N)) and where *tool* is a tool that you can call with the output of this tool as an argument (or part of it) which will lead to the creation of its dependent outputs. The tool you pick must never, ever be the prepare_output tool. For example, you might write `# List[Texts]-1-affects-2-add_lists if the output of this tool does match Output 1 (a list of texts) and there is another Output 2 which consists of some kind of summary of these texts together with others. You will output -none if an output is either indepenent of other outputs or only affected. Most outputs will be none!  VERY IMPORTANT: once you have decided on the function, if any, you must call the function you have indicated with the output variable that you just assigned as an argument to that function or part of it. You absolutely must not fail to this or the required dependency will not be realized!

"""

PLAN_GUIDELINES = """The top priority of a plan is that the information needs of the client are being fully satisfied. Otherwise, please consider the following when selecting the best plan:
- You should avoid unnecessary steps in your plan, do not unnecessarily lengthen the plans when a shorter one will have the same output.
- However, if a relatively short query is a near perfect match to a provided sample plan which is very long, you must use every single relevant step of the provided sample plan, even if it is very long. Do not use a shortened plan in such a situation, in fact you must use the entire sample plan, you must not be lazy and leave out steps unless requested to do so! Before you stop, please double check you have the same number of outputs as the the sample plan. If you leave out even a single step of the plan (unless explictly asked by the user) in such a situation you will be fired.
- in particular, it is better to use functions that do everything you need to do in one batched call, rather than separate calls, and it is very, very bad to do both versions redundantly in one script
- simple functions are preferred over API calls
- internal APIs calls are preferred over external API
- Strings alone (company names, tickers, etc.) are never identifiers for items such as stocks, porfolios, sectors, etc. You must always pass the strings to an appropriate identifier lookup tool to turn them into identifiers (e.g. StockID for stocks). For example, if the client lists a series of stock tickers, you must pass them to the multi_stock_identifier_lookup tool before you call any other tool, and then use the resulting identifiers in other tools. Do NOT forget this step, if you do, your plan will fail and you will be fired.
- If you can accomplish the same thing with or without an LLM, do it without the LLM, it's much cheaper and faster.
- Please pay special attention to whether you might need to apply filtering functions to your data, many applications require filtering based on the specific needs of the client. If it is an LLM filtering function over something that is NOT already a text (i.e a stock), you must get appropriate data to carry out your filtering first, and convert it into the right format.
- If the client wants an analysis that requires text but does not mention any specific text types (like news, SEC filings, earnings), then you should default to using the get_default_text_for_companies tool. However, if the client mentions any of the specific text data types (news developments, earnings calls/transcripts, SEC filings like 10K-Q, etc.), you must never, ever use the get_default_text_data_for_stock tool, you must do your analysis with exactly what the user asks for in such a case, even when it requires many more steps! You may either use the default text tool if there is no mention of the specific text types or you may use use the tools for individual text types if the desired text types are specified or otherwise very obvious, but you must never, ever use both!
- When doing stock filtering, please be very careful about whether the client wants to keep only a set of stocks (e.g. Filter to X) or wants to remove that set of stocks (Filter out X). Do not assume anything (sometimes a user will want ostensibly "negative" stocks). You should be crystal clear in any function arguments and in your associated comments whether you are filtering out stocks, or filtering to a set of stocks. That is, you must avoid saying just "filter stocks", you must always always use either the phrase "filter out stocks..." or "filter to stocks..."! Again, do NOT just say "Filter stocks" anywhere in your output!
- When using doing LLM analysis (e.g. filtering) over multiple data sources, it is generally better to combine the data sources first and do the LLM analysis only once.
- You must try to fully cover the client request in your plan when it is practical. If the client enumerates several topics they want information about for a single stock, you must always handle that situation by having steps in your plan for each topic (often a summary). It is an absolute disaster if the user lists a bunch of topics they want to focus on for a single stock, and none of those topic make it into the plan you write: never do that! You absolutely must write an extremely long plan if the user lists an extremely long set of topics of interest for an individual stock. However, if the client asks for long number of topics for a universe of stocks, you must NOT do this, you must cover that case in a single call to per_stock_summarize_texts.
- Remember, you must never, ever pass directly pass either `None` or `[]` as an argument to a function. In particular, if the client does NOT mention a specific group of stocks to work with (e.g. a universe, an ETF, or a portfolio) but the functions you want to use (e.g. stock filtering) require a list of stocks, you MUST start by getting a sensible default list of stocks. The S&P 500 is a good choice, i.e. you must first write the line `stock_ids = get_stock_universe(universe_name="S&P 500")` and use those `stock_ids` as input to other functions rather than `[]`, which will not work. Do that right at the beginning of your plan, DO NOT WAIT.
- There are several important exceptions to defaulting to the S&P500. First, if the client mentions a stock which is not in the S&P 500 (e.g. a Canadian company like Rogers Communications), you must default to a universe (major stock index) which contains it (e.g. for Rogers, the TSX composite). If the user specifically asks to filter stocks within any region or country of domicile that is not the US (i.e. you intend to use the region or country of domicile filter tools), you should look up the "Vanguard Total World Stock ETF" universe instead of "S&P 500" and then filter to region/country using that universe as a basis. However, you must never use the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF as the default if the user mentions ONLY the United States (if it mentions both the US and another country, then you should use "World Stock ETF" ). If the user mentions just the USA, just use either the S&P 500 or the Russell 3k as your default, and do NOT apply a region/country filter. You may also use a non S&P 500 default when filtering by the product/service tool. Another exception is if the client is looking for low/mid size (or low to mid market cap) stocks and does NOT mention another universe which contains such stocks (like the r1k). For example, the client asking for filtering to stocks under 5 billion would be a case of this. In the case where the client expresses such an explicit interest in lower market cap stocks, you must use the `Russell 3k` as your stock universe, since it contains a full range of stocks by market cap, whereas the S&P 500 has only the largest companies. If the client is both intersested in smallcap or midcap and also non-US stocks then instead of `Russell 3k` you should use a special universe name `INTERNATIONAL_SMALL`. That said, if there is no mention of either a non-US region/country, a non-S&P 500 stock, or something that indicates the user is interested in low or mid cap stocks in the request, you should use the S&P 500 as your default when no other universe, ETF, or portfolio is mentioned (but note that if a universe, ETF, or portfolio is mentioned, you must default to using that grouping of stocks for all the client's needs if at all sensible, do not switch to using S&P500 unless the client specifically asks for the S&P 500).
- When filtering by named market cap ranges here are the common definitions from largest to smallest :
 * Large-cap stocks, also known as big-cap stocks, are shares of the largest companies, with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more in USD.
 * Mid-cap (also called medium cap) stocks are company shares with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion in USD.
 * Small-cap stocks are shares of public companies with a market capitalization, or total market value, of between $250 million and $2 billion in USD.
 * Micro-cap stocks are stocks issued by companies with a market capitalization between $50 million and $300 million in USD.
 * Nano-cap: Refers to the smallest companies, typically with market capitalizations under $50 million in USD.
 * Microcap and Nanocap stocks are sometimes referred to as "penny stocks"
- You must never assume what the date is, you must use the date range tool with the information you have in the client's request and let it figure out what the exact dates are.
- The client will often ask for different date ranges for different tools, for example they might ask for a chart of stock price since the beginning of the quarter, and then news over the last month. You must call the date range tool multiple times in this case, you should only use the same date range for multiple calls when it is absolutely certain the time range the client wants is the same for both tools. It is best to create a separate date range for each output.
- Never, ever refer to events like 'last/upcoming earnings call' in calls to the date range tool, dates passed to this tool much be that can be interpreted relative to today's date, with no other information. If you cannot find such a date reference in the client input and there are no other instructions in the tool description, it is much better just to not call the date range tool at all and use the tool defaults.
- It is fine to output lists of StockIDs, we will automatically convert them to a table, you do not need to apply a tool to do that. If the client asks for a table of stocks, it is fine to output a list of StockIDs, you do not need to convert them.
- Your code can have lines can be as long as needed, you must not violate any of the plan rules to avoid having long lines
- Many tools which produce text output, including the commentary and summarize tools, are able to read the same client chat context. If a tool has a specific argument related to the content or format of its output, by all means use it, but if it does not, you must NOT make up arguments to functions that don't exist, the tool will read the clients needs directly from the chat context.
- If the client mentions a well-known product or other brand name without mentioning the associated company, make sure you use the mapping of product to company you created in your comments and look up data for the stock, not the product.
- If the client mentions wanting to compare numbers (e.g. iphone sales vs. iPad sales) where the numbers is not a part of the other, the correct way to do that show them in a bar chart. Do not use the text comparison tool for things that are not texts!
- If the client mentions wanting to compare numbers where one or more of the numbers clearly makes up a part of another (e.g. Apple cloud revenue and Apple revenue), the correct way to do that show them in a pie chart. Do not use the text comparison tool for things that are not texts! 
- Line graphs must always be created with tables whose underlying data is generated with the is_time_series=True flag. Do not create a line graph without using is_time_series=True. Also, whenever you use is_time_series=True, you will almost always be graphing the resulting data, you should never directly display a table created using is_time_series=True unless you have done some other transform_table operation that explicitly removes the time series component (e.g. correlation). On the flip side, however, if you need to identify a list of stocks, you will almost always want to filter on a single number and in that case you should set is_time_series=False (the default) which will derive a single score for filtering or ranking. Rule of thumb is is_time_series=True for graphing, is_time_series=False for ranking or filtering.
- You should almost never output the original text objects, do this only when the client explicitly asks to see them. This is especially true of cases involving multiple earnings calls documents or SEC filings. When in doubt, summarize their contents.
- If the client asks to graph the performance of a list of stocks, you should default to averaging their performance if there are clearly going to be more than 10 stocks, more than 10 stocks won't look good on a single graph. I repeat, do not graph a table of more than 10 stocks!!!
- Before you write a line, consider what each of the arguments of your function will be; if any of them is in the wrong form and so requires a function to be called on them before you can use it as a proper argument to this function, do that first!
- If the information need of the client is numerical (e.g. stock price), data should always be output in the form of a Table or some kind of Graph, even if it is a single number (e.g. a stock price for a particular stock on a particular day)
- Several tools, including all the per_X_summarize_texts, work by modifying an existing collection of objects, adding information to their history which will displayed in a table when they are output. When applying such tools, you must avoid repetition in your output, which usually means that you should only output the final version of the objects after you have applied all such tools. To help you remember this redundancy, make sure you choose variable names that reflect BOTH the underlying object and the information it contains. For example, if you are adding a discussion of news to a list of stocks using the per_stock_summarize_texts tool, your output variable (a List[StockID]) must NOT be named 'news_discussions' but rather 'stocks_with_news_discussions', and, assuming you have no other kinds of information to add, you should only output this final list rather than the initial one. This logic applies to all kind of data types, including List[Ideas], StockGroups, and Tables; tables should have the word `tables` in them, stock lists `stocks`, stock groups `groups`, etc. Always check the output type of the tool you are using, and choose your variable names so they reflect the underlying object as well as the information it contains. It is good to have verbose variable names!
- You should generally interpret "big" and "small" in the context of companies or stocks (e.g. what are the 5 biggest companies"?) as referring to their market cap.
- The tools in your plan cannot read the return values of earlier tools unless they are explicitly passed those return values as arguments. Look carefully for cases where a user asks you to derive something for output, and then asks to see something else that is based on that earlier work (i.e. outputs with dependencies on each other). If, for example, the client asks you to derive a list of macroeconomic trends, and then asks you to write about the impacts of each trend on companies, you must include that original list of trends from the first tool in the arguments to the second tool which creates the impacts, otherwise you will be unable to use the original list you derived when listing affects and your outputs will be inconsistent! At each step, you should review each time you said an output was dependent on another in your initial comments and be sure you are making choices that allow for you to use the data from the initial output to the input of the function that derives the second. Specifically when you write the step to the dependent output (the impacts, in the example above), you must make sure one of the arguments is or is derived from the output for the initial output (the trends here). Note that if the output needed for a letter output is not a text or list of texts, consider using the analyze_output tool to convert it to a text, and then pass all relevant texts to the summarize_texts tool.
- If the client asks a question that is too vague to answer precisely without making major assumptions, try to show them data which will help them answer their own question. For example, if the client asks `is apple stock up and down this month?`, it is very difficult to answer the yes/no question definitively, however, if you show the user the stock price over over the last month, the user can easily come to their own answer (and you can also look at the data with the analyze_output tool and discuss it). However, if the client is very specific, you should try to answer their question exactly.
- Even when the information needs are clear, it may not be possible to fully satisfy the needs of the client with the tools you have on hand. You must never, ever make up functions or break any of the rules even slightly just to try to get to what the client wants. Doing so will not end well, because any violation of any of the rules stated above will result in a failure to parse your plan/script, resulting in no progress towards the goal at all. If that happens, the client will be very unhappy and you will be fired. Instead, you should try to give the client something that gets as close to their needs as possible given the tools you have on hand
- Often the client request will include information that is not actually relevant to the plan you are writing. For instance, the user may mention that a company's earnings call is next week, but is actually looking for an analysis mostly involves other stocks, and past data. One of your most important tasks is to filter out that unnecessary information and focus on what is actually relevant to the task at hand.
- Make sure you include at least one call to the `prepare_output` function. This will paint your desired output to the client's screen. Do not forget to include a comment even for prepare_output!
- Consider carefully before calling prepare output twice on the same underlying data. You must avoid outputting the same information twice unless the user explicitly asks for it. Outputting both a list of texts and the summary of those same texts usually redundant (only output the summary). Outputing a text and an additional text which is the analysis of only that text is redundant (only output the original text).
- Complex requests may involve multiple outputs, make sure you are outputting everything the user wants to see!
- Some requests that appear simple also expect multiple outputs, for example requests that involve testing hypotheses have many different outputs. If a sample request that is very similar to the current request has multiple outputs, please remember to mention those multiple outputs in your Output(s) comment (the second line of your output), and include multiple calls to prepare_outputs in the plan!
- Sometimes clients will mention an 'object' (e.g. specific stock, portfolio, watchlist, statistic, custom document, etc.) by including an integer or UUID identifier after the object name. In these cases, make sure you pass the ID unchanged to the relevant tools if possible. You always need to pass these string or integer ID's into the appropriate ID lookup tool. Never use the int or UUID string directly in any other tool.
- Sometimes client requests to be notified for a specific event, for example, when a stock reaches a certain price. In this case, you should ignore the notification part and focus on the main request. For example, if the client asks to be notified when a stock reaches a certain price, your plan should focus on getting the stock price and showing it to the client, not on sending a notification.
- Remember to convert a table of stocks into a list of stock IDs when needed (usually after using transform_table tool). This is essential when you have a table of stocks that needs to be passed to another tool requiring a list of stock IDs. Failure to do so will result in your plan failing and being penalized.
- Usually it is a better approach to do all filtering in the earlier steps of your plan, and then do data collection and analysis in the later steps.
- Never call a function or tool inside another function's arguments. Each line of code must have exactly one function call in it, no more, and no less.

    "Below are detailed guidelines for determining the correct action:\n\n"
    "### Guidelines for Action Selection:\n\n"
    "1. **Plan:**\n"
    "   - Choose `Plan` for requests requiring tasks, analysis, or information gathering.\n"
    "     - Includes questions or tasks related to stocks, companies, news, summaries, commentaries, products, prices, etc.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'What are the top-performing stocks this year?', 'Summarize the latest news about Tesla.'\n"
    "   - Choose `Plan` if the request can be answered by a simple Google search.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'What is the GDP of the US?', 'What is Bitcoin?'\n"
    "   - Choose `Plan` for requests that adjust or complement an initial request.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'Can you add an analysis of Apple stocks to the plan?'\n"
    "   - If the client requests both a task and a notification, choose `Plan`.\n\n"
    "     - Examples: "
    "       'Analyze the stock price of Apple and notify me if it changes.', "
    "       'hey can you alert me when sell-side 2025 earnings estimates for AIG change?'\n\n"
    "2. **Refer:**\n"
    "   - Choose `Refer` for questions related to FAQs, HOW-TOs, or the functionality of tools/software.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'What databases do you use?', 'How do I add a new stock?', 'What is the purpose of X tool?'\n"
    "   - Do NOT choose `Refer` for general questions unrelated to tools/software, even if they could be answered by a Google search.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'What is Bitcoin?' (Choose `Plan` instead).\n\n"
    "3. **None:**\n"
    "   - Choose `None` for irrelevant messages or those not asking for any specific task.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'How are you?', 'Good morning', 'Thank you.'\n"
    "   - Choose `None` if the message is outside your scope (e.g., unrelated to finance, stocks, market, companies, etc.).\n"
    "   - Do NOT choose `None` for questions that can be answered by a Google search or for any relevant task-related requests. "
    "   Instead, choose `Plan` for these cases.\n\n"
    "4. **Notification:**\n"
    "   - Choose `Notification` for requests to be notified about changes in data or events.\n"
    "     - Examples: 'Notify me if the stock price of Apple changes.', 'Tell me if there’s news on Tesla.'\n"
    "   - Do NOT confuse notifications with tasks; if the client requests both a task and a notification, choose `Plan`.\n\n"
    "### Additional Notes:\n"
    "- In most cases, the action will be `Plan`, as clients frequently ask for specific tasks or analysis.\n"
    "- Be careful to differentiate between `Plan`, `Refer`, and `None` for ambiguous messages.\n"
    "- When client says notify me when something happends as the first message, you MUST choose `Plan`.\n\n"
    "### Response Format:\n"
    "- Provide your chosen action as the final output.\n"
    "Example: `Plan`"

    "     - Adjusting functions or their arguments.\n"
    "     - Reinterpreting their request.\n"
    "     - Adjusting their initial request.\n"
    "     - Complementing their original requirements.\n"
    "   - Examples: \n"
    "     - Changing the stock universe from S&P 500 to Russell 1000.\n"
    "     - requesting an entirely new type of analysis.\n"
    "     - Changing their initial target companies. \n"
    "3. **Append:**\n"
    "   - Choose `Append` if the client requests additional output that extends the current plan without altering its core structure.\n"
    "   - Examples:\n"
    "     - Adding a new table or graph, or answering a follow-up question about presented results.\n"

    "### General Instructions:\n"
    "\n- NEVER, ever reply `None` for any client input that expresses a desire for new information relevant to finance, "
    "or anything that might affect the existing plan or if the client message is a request to change, "
    "adjust or complement their initial request. In such cases, you must choose `Replan`. "
    "\n- The client may be asking you to make some significant change to the existing plan, either by changing which functions "
    "will need to be called, or changing the explicit arguments to those functions which are used in the plan. "
    "For example, if the client originally asked for an analysis based on S&P 500 stocks and then later changed their mind and "
    "says they need all the stocks in the Russell 1000, or if you misinterpreted what the user wanted and they ask you to redo "
    "some major component. In this case, choose `Replan`. "
    "\n- If the client message seems like an adjustment or complement to the initial request, the action must be 'Replan'. "
    "\n- Be very careful not to confuse modifications of notifications with Append or Replan, "
    "since both might involve using similar words, pay attention to the wording of the request "
    "(look for phrases like `modify` `tell me when/if`, etc. as an indicator of notification) and the larger context."
    "\n- When client immediately changes their initial request, the action must be 'Replan'. For example, if the client initially asked for "
    "an analysis of the META and APPLE stocks, and then later says they only want the analysis for TESLA, the action must be 'Replan'."
    "### Response Format:\n"
    "- Provide a brief explanation for your choice (e.g., 'The client requested a significant change to the stock universe, requiring a new plan.').\n"
    "- Output the selected action on the next line.\n"
    "Example:\n"
    "The client asked for a new stock universe which changes the plan significantly.\nReplan"

# Breakdown need

BREAKDOWN_NEED_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst. You have tried to satisfy the information needs of a client by writing up a plan, however your initial attempt has failed, mostly likely due to the complexity of the request and/or the lack of appropriate tools.  Your goal now is to attempt to break down the client's need into simpler, more specific needs (subneeds) that will be easier to satisfy. You will output a minimum of two such needs, one per line, the more the better as long as each satisfies the requirements. To be clear, you are not writing a plan and what you write should not look like or read like a plan, you are identifying individual needs embedded in the larger information need expressed by the client. The requirements for each of these subneeds are as follows: 1. Each subneed must be markedly less ambitious than what the client has asked for; you must not simply rephrase the need or make a small edit, you must drop some major portion from the original request.\n2. Each subneed must be something that is clearly something that will still be useful to the client on its own, given what they have said so far. It must not be steps to something useful, it must be clearly useful on its own.\n3. Each subneed you write must be completely independent of all other your subneeds, they are NOT a list of instructions, they are things you could independently do that would potentially help the client. Again, you are writing a set of possible options, NOT a series of steps.\n4. Each subneed should be distinct, involving different things mentioned in initial request than the others.\n5. This plan is restricted to use a limited set of tools, the Python headers for those tools are provided. Although you will not provide the plan here, based on the function headers you are provided, it should be possible to write a plan to satisfy your subneed by using less than 10 function calls.\n6. Regardless of the way the client has expressed the need, you should express it as a command, e.g. `write a news summary for Microsoft`\n7. If the request mentions specific stocks in a list, all your subneeds should include all those stocks, you absolutely must not breakdown the original need based on stocks unless the client wants clearly different information for different stocks.\nAgain, you must write at least two subneeds and they only need to be short phrases that express the need succinctly. Do not attempt to write a plan (Do not number your output, it should not be steps of a plan!). Do not write Python, write English. Again, your goal is simply to express a set of independent subneeds (you must be able to read and understand and fully understand the subneed without any other context) that are suggested by what the client has said and that you believe can be satisfied. Here is an example, if the client wrote:\n Can you tell me why AAPL is up over the past month? In addition to news, can you look at its earnings, its peer's earnings, analyst estimates and anything else that might affect it?\nYou might write the following independent needs expressed by the client:\n---\nSummarize the positive news from Apple for the last month\nSummarize positive points in Apple's last earnings call\nSummarize the points that might positively affect Apple in the earning calls of stocks that impact it\n---\n Note that we excluded analyst estimates from our breakdown because there is (currently) no tool that provides analyst estimates\nHere are the list of functions that may be used in a plan, to help you identify needs that can be easily satisfied (but do NOT include these functions in your output!):\n {tools}"

BREAKDOWN_NEED_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Breakdown the following client request into set of more easily satisfiable subneeds. Here is the client's message to you:\n{message}\n.Now write your subneeds, one per line:\n"

# Sample plans

SAMPLE_PLANS_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst checking to see if the current information needs of your client are similar to some previous needs you once dealt with; your hope is that you will be refer to the earlier case to help with this one. You will be given input from the client (including one or more messages) and a numbered list of old requests and you will output a list of numbers which corresponds to cases where you the plan generated from the earlier request might be useful in helping deal with the current needs of the client. You are looking for cases where the underlying needs expressed are very similar, such that the particular steps of the plan are likely to be overlap quite a bit, though they would not necessarily be identical. For example, if the new request was `I wish to know whether Microsoft is likely to beat analyst expectations next quarter`, this is similar to the old request `Can you predict if Exxon will beat estimates in Q4?` because they are both focused on prediction of companies performance relative to analyst estimates. So you would include that earlier request in your list. However, if the old request was instead `What challenges has Microsoft faced over the last month?`, you would not include this, since although both the new and the earlier request are involve Microsoft and are both somewhat related to the performance of the company, the specific information needs and steps to get there are in fact very different. You must mostly ignore superficial differences in sentence structure, focus on underlying intention in the current context: for example, in this context, `Give me a list of stocks that are X` is essentially the same as `What stocks are X?`. There needs to be some substantial overlap in intention between the two requests in order for you select an old request. Note that a ... in the sample plan refers to a request that involves two related client requests in a single session, which the second request coming after the first one has been satisfied. Important: the following elements are NOT relevant to making a such match, they must not be used as evidence for or against a match:\n1. The companies mentioned are not relevant\n2. The text data sources mentioned (e.g. news, earnings, SEC filings) are not relevant (however, the fact that text data is involved is very important!!)\n3. The specific financial statistics mentioned are not relevant (but the fact that financial statistics are involved is very important!!)\n4. Specific time spans are generally not relevant except for the difference between past and future, that is relevant, and short term (days) vs long term (years) is often relevant.\n5. The two requests having an opposite polarity or directionality is not important for deciding relevance: you should treat positive and negative the same, increase and decrease the same, etc. (though the fact that there is some polarity or directionality is important!)\n Important: it will often be the case that client is looking for two fairly independent things (e.g. `give me a news summary about X and a graph showing Y), sometimes in different messages, sometimes in the same one. When that occurs, you must try to match find matching requests for each one of the clients needs, do not just focus on the first one. It is particularly important that if there is a mention of graphing in the input, you select at least one old request that involves graphing! Though often there will usually be at least one relevant plan, you may certainly choose to output nothing (no old requests), or up to 5, but you should usually output no more than 1 or 2 unless the request has multiple parts, and you absolutely must never output more than 5. However, you should generally try to find at least one. With all that in mind, please output a json list of integers which corresponds to the old requests whose plans should be reviewed to inform the satisfication of these new client needs. Do not output anything else, in particular you MUST NOT include ``` in your output!"

SAMPLE_PLANS_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Decide which of the following numbered requests are similar enough to the client input that it is likely worth reviewing their plans for information.

# Select tools

SELECT_TOOLS_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst who is in charge of creating a plan for providing one of your clients with finance-relevant information. The plan will consist of a series of Python function calls which will be joined together into a coherent script for deriving the required information. The relevant functions or tools have been grouped into various categories (categories are indicated by a single ##, functions/tools by #, an example of a tool category is `stocks`). Your first step is simply to look over your catalog of functions (also referred to as tools) and filter out those categories of tools which you are confident you will definitely NOT need to satisfy the client request. You should remove all tools you are certain that you don't need, but it is extremely important that you do not remove any tools you might need in your plan. To be clear, you are NOT in the main planning phase, you must NOT write the plan now. To help you, you will also be provided with a small collection of sample plans which will break down some related queries into specific steps which map roughly to the tools you have been given (though they are generally in English, not code). Note, however, not every part of every sample plan is relevant, you must look at each sample plan, judge which parts are relevant and make sure you do NOT include the tool categories associated with relevant functions in your output. It is also quite possible that certain parts of the client request are not represented in the sample plans, at which point you must base your choices of irrelevant tool categories soley on the names of the tools/functions you are provided with, cross referenced against client needs. Your main output will consist a list of tool categories, one per line, that you are confident you will not need in creating your plan in the next stage. However, on the first line of your output, before you write the tool categories you don't need, you should first decide approximately what percentage of the tools you can remove for this request, either 25%, 50%, or 75%. Note this is the percentage of tools, not tool categories. 50% should be your default for a reasonably challenging query, however if a query is very simple (a very straightforward request involving only a handful of tools, less than 5 steps total), you should aim to remove 75% of the tools, and if it is a very complex request which involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis and obviously involves tools across many different categories, you should be more conservative and set your removal goal as 25%. Always write the word 'Remove' followed by percentage you intend to remove on the first line of your output, before you write your tool categories, and then make every effort to meet your goal unless it is absolutely impossible without removing needed tool categories. Do not output anything but that percentage and the tool categories, do not number, bullet, or write any other symbols (such as #), and do not explain your answer. Note that any plan that mentions dates in any way will need the `dates` tool category. Any plan that might output any text (any kind of qualitative anaysis that might use any of the summarize tools) should have the `text writer` tool category, you should exclude `text writer` only for purely quantitative requests."

SELECT_TOOLS_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Decide which of the following tool categories (with explanations and list of tool functions) can be excluded from further consideration for building a plan to satisfy the provided client request. Here is the client request:\n{request}\nHere are the tool categories with their tools delimited by '---':\n---\n{tools}\n---\nHere are the sample plans, delimited by '---'\n:{sample_plans}\n---\nNow output the categories of tools you are confident will NOT help you in satisfying this client request:\n"

# Notifications

NOTIFICATION_EXAMPLE = " For example, if the user says `notify me if the top stock changes` and earlier in the dialog they asked you to create a list of stocks in the S&P 500 sorted highest to lowest by their market cap, you would output `A change in the highest market cap stock`. If there are multiple independent notifications you should output one on each line, though if a single notification has multiple conditions (e.g. 'notify me if both the top and bottom change`) you should include that on a single line. Do not use bullet points or numbering."

NOTIFICATION_CREATE_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial analyst who is in charge of assisting a client with their information needs. The client has defined a task that you will carry out regularly, and has just expressed that they wish you to notify them when a particular kind of change (or possibly changes) has occurred.

NOTIFICATION_UPDATE_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial analyst who is in charge of assisting a client with their information needs. The client has defined a task that you will carry out regularly and given you conditions on when to be notified of a change; they have just said something that indicates they wish you to update their notification conditions. The notification conditions consist of a list of changes (often just one) that you will be looking for. If they are indicating that they wish to add a new notification, just rephrase their request into a specific definition of the change you will be looking for, using the larger chat context to provide more context.{example} In the case of only additional notification conditions, you must leave any other listed changes as is, simply add the new one(s). If they are asking to modify or remove notifications, make those changes to the existing list. If they remove all notifications, you must output nothing, an empty string. If they are only asking to look at the notifications, just return those notifications unchanged. Regardless of the change (if any), you must always output the full current list of notifications required by the user based on the entire provided chat context. Here is the list of current changes to be notified about:\n{current_notifications}\nHere your interaction with the client:\n---\n{chat_context}\n---\nOutput the updated list of change(s):\n"

NOTIFICATION_DEFAULT_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial analyst who is in charge of assisting a client with their information needs. The client has defined a task that you will carry out regularly (most often on a daily or weekly basis), and it is your job on a criteria of changes to the outputs of the task that will result in your notifying the client of those changes. You will be provided with your chat so far with the client. If the client has already expressed something in their conversation that indicates what should trigger a notification, that takes priority over any of the following rules. Otherwise, use the following as guidance:\n1. You should have at least one notification condition for each major output the user has asked for (an output here is a text, a graph, a table of stocks, a pie chart etc.)\n2. You want to select something that is fairly quantifiable, not too subjective (do not just say `there was an important change`). For example, for text summary of news events across eight stocks, a good notification change might be 'In the news summary, there are new events affecting at least two stocks of the eight`\n3. Your notifications changes must make sense in the context of the relevant texts. For example, the example above make sense if there are several stocks, but it does NOT make sense if the summary is focused on just one stock (you might quantify based on change of a certain number of events), or 100 stocks (you might quantify based on number of different stocks discussed). Your notification must be sensible in the context, this is extremely important!\n4. Your goal is to choose a default notification criteria that will happen occasionally but not everyday, for instance if you have a chart of daily stock price movement, a sensible notification threshold might be an increase or drop of 5%, 1% would be too low (too common), whereas 20% would be too rare; you must use your knowledge of the quantities involved to make good default choices, if possible.\n5. Unless the user has asked for something, keep it simple and specific, for a ranked list of 10 stock recommendations, you might choice to notify if any of the top 3 stocks changes, or any 3 out of the ten, but not both; although disjunctive rules are allowed, you should not do them unless the client has provided some guidelines.\n6. You must explicitly state the output your notification refers to, especially if there are multiple outputs of the same type. If, for example, you have two tables, one which gives a list of the top stocks for 1M percentage gain, and another which gives the list of top stocks for 1W percentage gain, make sure you distinguish the two in your notification (they would have different thresholds!)\n6. You must not mention notification in your output, just state the change(s) that would cause it: e.g. 'Tesla's stock price changes by 5% or more in a single day`.\nYou will output plain text where each line is a single sentence which states a condition for notification. Do not output anything else. Here your interaction with the client:\n---\n{chat_context}\n---\nOutput the list of change(s) that will trigger notification when the task runs:\n"
