# shared plan stuff
# , and, in parenthesis after each one, a function you think you will use to include it your plan

PLAN_RULES = """- Your output script must be valid Python code
- The first line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Must haves: " where you should briefly list the key elements of the user input that you must include in your plan in short phrases of 1-3 words.
- The second line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Final output: " and must state the Python type and meaning of the final output. Remember that the final output should be human readable, it absolutely must not involve identifiers (e.g. stock_ids)! For example, List[int] for a variable that mentions stocks is list of stock identifiers and must be converted to tickers or names!
- The third line of your code should be a comment starting with "# Rough plan: " and should state in a single sentence how you intend to get to that output.
- All non-comment lines of code must consist of one assignment statement
- The left side of the assignment should be a single new variable
- The right side of your assignment statement must consist of exactly one function call, multiple function calls must use multiple lines, you must not output line that does not contain a tool call.
- I will say it again, because it is VERY IMPORTANT: each line of your code must have exactly one function call in it, no more, and no less. A functional call within the arguments, e.g. func1(a=func2(b)) counts as a second function for this purpose: DO NOT DO IT
- It is equally bad to have no function calls, you absolutely must not use a line to define a list (e.g. a = [b,c,d]) or a string (e.g. a = "a string"), just put the list/string directly in the arguments of any functions that need it
- The function used must come from the provided list of tools, you must not use any other standard Python functions
- You must not use any Python operators other than the assignment operator, you must the provided functions to carry out any required operations
- In particular, you absolutely must not use the Python indexes [], e.g. you must not write anything involving the characters `[]` that is not a definiing a list. This includes inside a function argument, e.g. func(a=b[0]) is not allowed. Instead use the provided function which does the same thing.
- Any arguments to the function must match the provided function headers in type. Be careful about inheritance, note that any type whose name ends with Text is a subclass of Text, any types whose name ends with Table is a subclass of Table, etc.
- Never pass None or any empty list to a function whose arguments are not explicitly Optional, you must figure out a way to generate that argument, see the guidelines for more information 
- You must include all required arguments, though you can exclude those with defaults if you are not changing them
- If values for any of the optional arguments (those with defaults) are mentioned or implied by the user input and different from the default, include those optional arguments.
- If an argument has a default value according to the function definition, you must not pass that default value as an argument, you must leave it out.
- Use explicit keyword arguments for all your arguments
- Any arguments to the function must consist of a single string, integer, float, or boolean literal, a variable, or a list of literals or variables. Do not include more complex python data structures, and you must never include a function as part of an argument. If you need to modify a existing variable in any way other that creating a list containing it, put it on a separate line
- You must NOT create a Python list on a separate line without a function call in it since each line MUST have one function. You must absolutely NOT produce a line like a = [b, c, d]. Instead, you should create the list in the argument, i.e. `a = func(arg=[a, b, c])`
- If you write a string literal in an argument, it must be delimited with double quotes and the string literal must not contain any of the following five characters delimited by `: `=,()"`
- Before each line of code, you will have a comment line which first has the one function you will use, and then all of the arguments to the function (you many only skip default arguments you are not changing), which must follow all the requirements, i.e. not containing functions, indexes, or operators. The arguments must also satisfy all the requirements mentioned in the description of the function, in particular some arguments must be of the same length. Do not include the keywords, just the argument values.  If there is not one function, or one of the argument violates one of the requirements, write another comment line which fixes the problems before you write the next line of code, this is much better than writing code which fails to satisfy the requirements.
- After each assignment, on the same line, write a comment that explains what is happening in that step. It should be fully understandable to a non-coder who cannot read the code itself
- In your comment, if the function name does not mention identifiers, you should not refer to them either, just talk about stocks, not stock indentifiers
- On the next line after each assignment, write a comment that states the exact type of the output variable assigned on the previous line. Then, check this against your final output type that you declared in your output comment on the third line; Say Yes if the type of the output of the last function matches the expected final output type from the Output exactly, or No if it does not, do not stop on a step where it does not match unless you have no choice!  For example, if you wrote `# Output: List[Text]` on line 3 above, then, if the previous function outputed a some_texts variable of type List[List[Text]], you would write `# List[List[Text]]-No` on this line because the type did not match exactly (there is an extra List).
- You must output a script/plan. If you are unable to write a script which fully satisfies the user's information need with the provided functions, or the exact user needs are unclear, write the best script that you can given the limitations
- You must output only one script/plan, do not output multiple plans, pick the best one using the provided guidelines
- You must write nothing other than the script
- I will say it one last time, do not include function calls in your arguments, you must put each function call on a separate line
"""

PLAN_GUIDELINES = """The top priority of a plan is that the information needs of the user are being fully satisfied. Otherwise, please consider the following when selecting the best plan:
- short plans are preferred over long ones
- in particular, it is better to use functions that do everything you need to do in one batched call, rather than separate calls, and it is very, very bad to do both versions redundantly in one script
- simple functions are preferred over API calls
- internal APIs calls are preferred over external API
- If you can accomplish the same thing with or with an LLM, do it without the LLM, it's much cheaper
- Please pay special attention to whether you might need to apply filtering functions to your data, many applications require filtering based on the specific needs of the user. If it is an LLM filtering function over something that is NOT already a text (i.e a stock), you must get appropriate data to carry out your filtering first, and convert it into the right format.
- When using doing LLM analysis (e.g. filtering) over multiple data sources, it is generally better to combine the data sources first and do the LLM analysis only once
- If the client does not mention a specific lists of stocks to work with but the functions you want to use require a list of stocks, you must start by getting a sensible default list of stocks, the S&P 500 is a good choice.
- You must never assume what the date is, you must use a tool that knows the date
- Your lines can be as long as needed, do not violate any of the rules to avoid having long lines
- Before you write a line, consider what each of the arguments of your function will be; if any of them is in the wrong form and so requires a function to be called on them before you can use it as a proper argument to this function, do that first!
- Only the output returned by the last line of the script will be shown to the user, so you must be sure that it has all the information the user is asking for and that it is human readable (your final output should never be identifiers)
- If the information need of the client is numerical (e.g. stock price), data should always be output in the form of a Table, even if it is a single number (e.g. a stock price for a particular stock on a particular day)"""

# Action decider

ACTION_DECIDER_SYS_PROMPT_STR = "You are a financial data analyst who is working with a client to satisfy an information need. You have previously formulated a plan, expressed as a Python script, in an attempt to satisfy that need. You have just received a new message from the client, and must select from one of four possible actions to take next with regards to the plan. You will need to read the new message carefully in the context of the current plan, and decide which of following is the best fit to the current situation. First, if the new input does not provide any new information at all and therefore there is no reason to take any action, you may choose to take no action at all by outputting `None`. An example of this might be the client simply saying something like `Okay` or `Understood`. However, you should never reply None for any client input that might affect the plan. On the other extreme, the user may be asking you to make some significant change to the existing plan, either by changing which functions will need to be called, or changing the explicit arguments to those functions which are used in the plan. For example, if the client originally asked for an analysis based on S&P 500 stocks and then later changed their mind and say they need all the stocks in the Russell 1000. In this case, output `Replan`. A third option is that the plan as it stands can be preserved as is, but something needs to be added. For example, the client could ask for some explanation or extension of an already complete analysis. In this case, you should output `Append`. The final case is only applicable when there is at least one function which reads the chat context, for instance the summarization function; a list of any such functions that occur will be provided to you. If there is such a function and the new message contains information that might change how that step is carried out, then, although it is not necessary to rewrite the plan, it does need to be rerun. Output `Rerun`. Again, never output this option if the list of functions that use chat context is empty. So, you will output one of the four options: `None`, `Rerun`, `Append`, and `Replan`. Before you output your choice, please write a very brief sentence which discusses your choice. For example, you might output: The user provided a new stock universe which requires a change to the arguments of one of the functions and a rewrite of the plan\nReplan\nYou must output the final option of the four given on the second line."

ACTION_DECIDER_MAIN_PROMPT_STR = "Decide which of the actions to take with regards to the following plan,  given that you have just received latest message in the chat with your investor client and need to potentially respond to it. Here is the current plan:\n---\n{plan}\n---\nHere is the (possibly empty) list of functions which reads the chat context, which is used in deciding if the Rerun case might be applicable: {reads_chat_list}\n Here is the chat so far:\n---\n{chat_context}\n---\nAnd finally here is the latest client message:\n---\n{message}\n---\nNow, decide which action to take: "
