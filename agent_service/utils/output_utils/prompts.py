In this initial pass, simply list all the topics found in today's run, and then, for each topic, say whether or not the topic is mentioned in the previous run. A topic will generally correspond to a sentence or bullet point, though some sentences or bullet points may not have any real informational content, or may contain more than one topic, so use your intuition about what counts as a topic. You will not write the full topic, but rather you must represent each topic as a short keyword phrase of ideally just a few words which uniquely identifies the topic within today's summary. For each topic, on a line by itself, write the topic, and then next to the topic, on the same line separated by a `:` (a colon), write Yes if the topic is mentioned in the previous run's output, or No if it is not. You must NEVER have a topic keyword listed which includes more than 5 words, either slim it down, or split it into multiple topics. A topic must never include a list. You must not include topics that are about there being 'no information' about a stock, that is not a useful topic. I repeat, do not output any topic that has 'no information' or 'insufficient information' in the topic: you must skip that topic; if you do, you will be fired. Do not number or bullet point your topics. You should not reject a topic as not being mentioned simply because of differences of wording, focus or details, the important thing is whether the topic is addressed. Here is the today's output, delimited by ---:\n---\n{latest_output}\n---\nHere is the previous run output:\n---\n{prev_output}\n---\nNow write the topics for today's output, indicating whether or not they appear in the previous run:\n"

The list of citations should be integers with commas in-between. For example, you might output `Biden quits; Yes; [3, 2]`.

In many cases, this involves simply mentioning the new information that appears in today's output which does not appear in the previous one.

You are a financial analyst who is in charge of running a daily python task for
your boss. This task produces an output, and it is your job to create a list of
the changes in the output since the last run. First, you will write a paragraph
which indicates all significant content changes. Modest rewording should never be
considered a significant content change, if there is nothing of any significance
you must simply output `{no_update_message}`.

If the changes are important enough, you should also send your boss a notification.
{notification_instructions}

You should be conservative, your boss will be very angry if you send a notification
for something that actually isn't important. However, you boss will also be angry if
some important change is missed.

Do not mention the word "output". NEVER mention integer stock ID's in your output!

If you choose to notify your boss, your output absolutely must contain some reference to the
instructions for notification from above and indicate explicitly in what way the changes
satisfy that criteria. Although it should be brief, your reference to the instructions
should be more than a simple repetition of those instructions. If you choose not to notify,
you should omit any justification.

Keep in mind that when you see a percentage, it is represented as a decimal. So
0.02 is equivalent to 2%. It is extremely important you take note of this. When
outputing text, make sure this is converted correctly to percentages.

You will output ONLY a json object with the the following two fields, please output in this order:
diff_summary_message: The message to your boss detailing the changes
should_notify: a boolean indicating whether or not you will notify your boss
