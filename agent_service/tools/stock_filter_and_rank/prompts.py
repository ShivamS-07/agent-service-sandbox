# Tool Descriptions

SIMPLE_PROFILE_DEFINITION = "the string must specify the exact property the desired companies have. For example, the string might be `companies which operate in Spain` or `companies which produce wingnuts used in Boeing airplanes`. If the client just expresses interest in companies related to a topic X in some way, the profile may also be `companies with recent Y that mention X` (where Y is a text type and X is the topic). The string passed into the profile argument MUST start with `companies which` and contain all information to understand why kind of companies we are looking for without any other context. In particular, do not include anaphoric language, do not say things `stocks like those` because we will not be able to interpret what `those` means without context, which we do not have here. If the client specifically mentions a relevant time range that defines the companies (i.e. a company which has undergone an event X within some time frame), you must mention that exact time range in the profile in addition to using the date range to collect texts. You must include all important details provided by the client in a single profile when possible, it is fine to include multiple conditions in (e.g. `Companies which produce wingnuts and which are based in Oklahoma`). It is extremely important to pass in a high quality string into the 'profile' argument as described earlier as this is what the stocks will be evaluated against. The more specific and detailed it is, the better the results will be. You should only use a simple profile when the specific property (or properties) that the client is looking for can be easily stated and you expect to find direct evidence which proves or disproves whether the company has the property in documents about the company. If there is a broad, diverse set of specific properties associated with what the client is looking for (e.g. `companies that are negatively affected by global warming`), you must use the generate_profiles tool and pass the result to this tool, do NOT use a simple string profile!"

SCORE_THRESHOLD_DEFINITION = "If the user has specified that they want to only see stocks in the results that score above a certain threshold then you must set score_threshold to the appropriate value (ie. if the user says only show me 3 stars or higher then score_threshold should be set to 3). By default score_threshold is set to 0 and will cut off any 0 scoring stocks. If the user wants to see every single stock ranked, then the score_threshold should be set to 0. The argument passed in to score_threshold must be an integer between 0 and 5! If the user says things like 'Show me strong matches' you should set the score threshold to 3 as to only show stocks with a score higher than 3."

FILTER_BY_PROFILE_DESCRIPTION = f"This function takes a list of stocks ('stocks'), a list of StockTexts about those stocks, and a profile. Neither of the lists can be empty! It uses an LLM to filter the list of stocks to a smaller list of stocks. If the user has requested a ranking or scoring of a list of stocks based on a profile match do not use this function under any circumstances, use the rank_stocks_by_profile tool instead! Additionally, you must never for any reason use this tool as a way to filter down a list of stocks to use as an input to the `rank_stocks_by_profile` tools as this will result in a catestrophic failure. Stocks in the input list are included in the output list if and only if the stock matches the provided profile based on the information in the corresponding texts for that stock. The texts passed to this tool must be the output of a text retrieval tool like `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` that produces List[StockText]. The text retrieval tool(s) you use must be called with the same stocks in the `stocks` list as the argument.  Do NOT pass the output of `get_news_articles_for_topics` or `get_news_and_web_pages_for_topics` to this tool, its Texts are not tagged by specific stocks and cannot be used in the tool. Very, very important: This function does NOT filter a text or a set of texts. Do not use it for this purpose. In most cases you think you want to use this function to filter texts, you actually want to use the summarize_text tool with the topic argument, which has a filtering effect. There are two datatypes the profile argument will accept. The first is as a string which must specify the exact property the desired companies have. If passing in a string into the profile argument, {SIMPLE_PROFILE_DEFINITION} Alternatively, if the user is interested in a broad topic like ('companies involved in wind energy') you may want to instead pass in a TopicProfiles object that is generated through the generate_profiles tool to get better results. This object will act as a more verbose alternative to the string option. {SCORE_THRESHOLD_DEFINITION} If you are filtering stocks, you will use this function, do not filter using filter_news_by_topic! For example, if the client asked for a list of stocks which had news about product releases in the last week, you would collect news for those stocks over the last week and call this function with the profile `companies with product release news in the last week`, you do not need to filter to press release news first! The text inputs to this function must be documents specifically about the stocks provided, the function used to acquire the data must take the same list of stock_ids as arguments. You must never, ever pass an empty list of texts to this function, and it almost never makes sense to pass one or a small fixed set, remember that your output is a list of stocks which satisfy a profile, not texts! Be careful about cases where the profile involve a company, e.g. 'looking for stocks which are suppliers to Apple`, Apple is part of the profile, it must NOT be passed to as the `stocks` argument, `stocks` must be a pool of stocks you want to search to find apple suppliers! If the client does not mention a specific kinds of texts to use for this filter (e.g. news, SEC filing, earnings call, custom document, etc.), just call the `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` tool before this one to get a list of all texts for the stocks. However, if the client specifically mentions a kind of text or kinds of texts to use in the filtering, then the list of texts passed in to this tool must include exactly those kinds of texts and no others. For example, if the client says `Give me stocks that mention buybacks in their earnings calls or sec filings`, then the `texts` argument to this function must ONLY include earnings calls summaries and sec filings, you must NOT pass all text data. I repeat: when the client does NOT specify the kind of documents that should be used, you must default to using the `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` tool for relevant stocks when you use this tool, but if the client does specify particular text types, no matter how many, you must pass only the kinds of documents that the client wants to this tool. Never just use company descriptions unless that is what the client asks for! The output of this function is a filtered list of stocks, not texts. Never use this function to answer a question about a single stock, use the answer question tool. Never use this function to filter stocks based purely on news sentiment, instead use the stock recommendation tool with filter=True and news_only=True. Never use this function when the client clearly wants to filter to a list of companies who all provide the same product, use the product or services tool for that, however this function should be used for other product-related filters (e.g. companies that use a product) or if they are looking to identify companies who carry out other operations (e.g. research) that cannot strictly be understood as product or services that are sold to consumers. You should avoid calling this tool with huge numbers of stocks/texts (more than 1000). Do any other stock filters in the request first when possible and (unlike the product filter tool) never, ever pass all stocks from a large stock universe like the r3k or the World Stock ETF to this tool unless the client demands it."


RANK_STOCKS_BY_PROFILE_DESCRIPTION = f"""You must invoke this function whenever a user expresses a desire to rank, score, or see what the top and/or bottom N companies are, with respect to some description of a specific type of company. If the user has expressed a desire to do this, then do not apply any filtering beyond possibly a sector filter via the sector_filter tool, and do not use any recommendation tool either such as get_stock_recommendations however under no circumstances are you allowed to filter by any profiles. This function must never be used alongside filter_stocks_by_profile_match nor is it ever allowed to take the outputs from filter_stocks_by_profile_match as its input. This function takes a list of stocks via the 'stocks' argument along with a list of texts associated with the input stocks via the 'stock_text' argument. Neither of these lists can be empty. The texts passed to this tool must be the output of a text retrieval tool such as `get_all_text_data_for_stocks` called with the same stocks in the `stocks` list as the argument. The purpose of this function is to rank and score a list of stocks based on the associated texts for each stock according to how strongly they match a the given company description. If a user has requested to rank a list of stocks by some common financial statistic like market cap, P/E ratio, returns, etc. must use the `transform_table` tool. This function must only be used when a user requests a ranking or requests of scoring for a list of stocks or get some top/bottom X best stocks, if the user has requested to filter a list of stocks you must use the `filter_stocks_by_profile_match` tool instead. The company description can be either passed in as a string through the 'profile' argument, {SIMPLE_PROFILE_DEFINITION} Alternatively, if the user is interested in a broad topic like ('companies involved in wind energy') you may want to instead pass in a TopicProfiles object that is generated through the generate_profiles tool to get better results. The output of this function returns the list of stocks sorted in descending order by the score they have been assigned, which is calculated based on how strongly each company fit the profile given. {SCORE_THRESHOLD_DEFINITION} Additionally, if the top N stocks are desired, a 'top_n' argument can be passed in, upon which this function will only return the 'top_n' stocks, also in descending order of relevancy/exposure. Only use this function when you want to rank stocks by some specific profile, do not use this function for any other purpose. Likewise, if the bottom M stocks are desired, a 'bottom_m' argument can be passed in, upon which this function will only return the 'bottom_m' stocks. If a user wants some top N and bottom M stocks to be returned you must specify those arguments when invoking this tool and the tool will return the top_n and bottom_m stocks. If this behavior is not desired by the user, do not pass in any value to either of these arugments and the full list of ranked stocks will be returned. It is extremely important to pass in a high quality string into the 'profile' argument as described earlier as this is what the stocks will be evaluated against. The more specific and detailed it is, the better the results will be.

If the user does not mention a specific kinds of texts to use for this filter (e.g. news, SEC filing, earnings call, custom document, etc.), just call the `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` tool before this one to get a list of all texts for the stocks. However, if the client specifically mentions a kind of text or kinds of texts to use in the filtering, then the list of texts passed in to this tool must include exactly those kinds of texts and no others. For example, if the client says `Give me stocks that mention buybacks in their earnings calls or sec filings`, then the `texts` argument to this function must ONLY include earnings calls summaries and sec filings, you must NOT pass all text data.

Never just use company descriptions unless that is what the client asks for! You should avoid calling this tool with huge numbers of stocks/texts (more than 1000). If a client has asked about fit to a given profile for all stocks within some large ETF or stock universe, you must filter the stocks down to the applicable stocks by using the sector_filter tool first, using an appropriate sector that well encapsulates the profile given to you! However you must not filter using the filter_stocks_by_profile_match as this will result in catestrophic failure."""

FILTER_AND_RANK_STOCKS_BY_PROFILE_DESCRIPTION = f"""This function is an dramatically improved version of both the rank_stocks_by_profile and filter_stocks_by_profile_match tools, and unifies the processes of both tools into one. Whenever there is a case where you have been instructed to use one of those tools you must call this tool instead for superior results. If you have been explicitly instructed to use either the rank_stocks_by_profile and/or filter_stocks_by_profile_match tools, your job is to invoke this tool instead.

This function takes a list of stocks ('stocks'), a list of StockTexts about those stocks, and a profile. Neither of the lists can be empty! The purpose of this tool is through the use of an LLM, it will filter and optionally rank the list of stocks to a smaller list of stocks relevant to the given profile. Stocks in the input list are included in the output list if and only if the stock matches the provided profile based on the information in the corresponding texts for that stock. The texts passed to this tool must be the output of a text retrieval tool like `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` that produces List[StockText]. The text retrieval tool(s) you use must be called with the same stocks in the `stocks` list as the argument.  Do NOT pass the output of `get_news_articles_for_topics` or `get_news_and_web_pages_for_topics` to this tool, its Texts are not tagged by specific stocks and cannot be used in the tool. Very, very important: This function does NOT filter a text or a set of texts. Do not use it for this purpose. In most cases you think you want to use this function to filter texts, you actually want to use the summarize_text tool with the topic argument, which has a filtering effect. There are two datatypes the profile argument will accept. The first is as a string which must specify the exact property the desired companies have. If passing in a string into the profile argument, {SIMPLE_PROFILE_DEFINITION} Alternatively, if the user is interested in a broader topic which might require more brainstorming to identify specific  ('companies involved in wind energy') you may want to instead pass in a TopicProfiles object that is generated through the generate_profiles tool to get better results. This object will act as a more verbose alternative to the string option.

If you are filtering or ranking stocks, you will use this function, do not filter using filter_news_by_topic! For example, if the client asked for a list of stocks which had news about product releases in the last week, you would collect news for those stocks over the last week and call this function with the profile `companies with product release news in the last week`, you do not need to filter to press release news first! The text inputs to this function must be documents specifically about the stocks provided, the function used to acquire the data must take the same list of stock_ids as arguments. You must never, ever pass an empty list of texts to this function, and it almost never makes sense to pass one or a small fixed set, remember that your output is a list of stocks which satisfy a profile, not texts! Be careful about cases where the profile involves a company, e.g. 'looking for stocks which are suppliers to Apple`, Apple is part of the profile, it must NOT be passed as the `stocks` argument, `stocks` must be a pool of stocks you want to search to find apple suppliers! If the client does not mention specific kinds of texts to use for this filter (e.g. news, SEC filing, earnings call, custom document, etc.), just call the `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` tool before this one to get a list of all texts for the stocks. However, if the client specifically mentions a kind of text or kinds of texts to use in the filtering, then the list of texts passed in to this tool must include exactly those kinds of texts and no others. For example, if the client says `Give me stocks that mention buybacks in their earnings calls or sec filings`, then the `texts` argument to this function must ONLY include earnings calls summaries and sec filings, you must NOT pass all text data. I repeat: when the client does NOT specify the kind of documents that should be used, you must default to using the `get_default_text_data_for_stocks` tool for relevant stocks when you use this tool, but if the client does specify particular text types, no matter how many, you must pass only the kinds of documents that the client wants to this tool. Never just use company descriptions unless that is what the client asks for!

This tool will, for each idea, use an LLM to filter the list of stocks to a smaller list of stocks. The 'complete_ranking' argument is a boolean which when set to True will instruct the tool to fully rank the stocks into distinct scores in addition to sorting them into levels. This should be set to True when the client has asked to see "the best" or "the worst" stocks/companies for a given profile, producing a sorted list of best to worst stocks given a profile with each stock having a unique floating point score between 0 to 5. If the client has simply asked to see companies related to a profile and has not made any mention of "ranking", "best"/"worst", "most exposed to" or other similar language, set complete_ranking to False, which will result in the tool assigning each stock an integer score from 0 to 5. {SCORE_THRESHOLD_DEFINITION}

Typically, companies that do not pass an initial relevance filter will be excluded from the final ranking. The `no_filter` argument can be used to remove that initial filter and provide a full ranking of every stock in the input, provided there is at least some relevant text. The default for `no_filter` is False, but you should change it to True if the client explicitly indicates that they want a score for every stock (e.g. they say 'rank every stock based on X' or 'give me an X score for all stocks'). It should only be set to True when `complete_ranking` is also True, but if you are setting complete_ranking = True, please consider whether the user seems to want all stocks in the output rather than just the most relevant ones, and if so, set no_filter=True'

There are two other arguments, 'top_n' and 'bottom_m'. These are optional arguments and should never have data passed in unless the client has explictly stated they want the top N and/or bottom M stocks to be returned in which case you should pass those values in as integers into 'top_n' and 'bottom_m' respectively. If the client makes no mention of "top" or "bottom" number of stocks they are interested in, then you must not pass in any value to either of these arugments. This is extremely important, DO NOT pass in an argument to top_n or bottom_m if the client has not explicitly asked for the top or bottom number of stocks. If you pass in a top_n when the user has only asked for "best stocks" then you will immediately be fired.

The output of this function is a list of stocks, not texts. Never use this function to answer a question about a single stock, use the answer question tool. Never use this function to filter stocks based purely on news sentiment, instead use the stock recommendation tool with filter=True and news_only=True. Never use this function when the client clearly wants to filter to a list of companies who all provide the same product, use the product or services tool for that, however this function should be used for other product-related filters (e.g. companies that use a product) or if they are looking to identify companies who carry out other operations (e.g. research) that cannot strictly be understood as product or services that are sold to consumers. You should avoid calling this tool with huge numbers of stocks/texts (more than 1000). Do any other stock filters in the request first when possible and (unlike the product filter tool) never, ever pass all stocks from a large stock universe like the r3k or the World Stock ETF to this tool unless the client demands it.

It also includes an explanation for why each stock was included in each group, you should output the StockGroups object directly, do NOT run the per_stock_group_summarize_texts tool on the output of this tool unless the user explicitly asks for more information about the resulting stock groups, other than what they are and why they were chosen.

# Rubric Generation
PROFILE_RUBRIC_GENERATION_SYS_PROMPT_STR = """You are a highly skilled financial analyst. You have been tasked with designing a scoring rubric for how well a particular company matches with a given 'profile'. A 'profile' can be a couple of different things but fundamentally it is a multi-paragraph description or summarization of a particular industry, sector, or field. Your scoring rubric will be broken down into five distinct levels, 1 to 5. Where level 1 is any company that has little or no relation to the 'profile' in question, level 2 is given to any company that barely aligns with the information given in the profile at all and a level 5 describes a company that is nearly a perfect match for the kind of company that would 'fit' what the profile describes. Design your rubric with the understanding that it will be used by an evaluator to assess individual companies to assign a level of fit to the profile you will be shown, however this evaluator will not have access to the actual profile. It will only see the specific rubric you design, thus, you must provide a sufficient level of detail and specificity in the descriptions for each level of your rubric such that it can be used as a standalone assessment tool. In any of your levels, do not make any mention of the word profile itself, instead making referencing to the details given to you within the profile. The rubric generated must be designed to act as a standalone assessment tool.

{additional_instruction}

You will structure your output as follows. First, explain and justify your approach and the criteria you will use to form your rubric. Next you will output on a new line the words "{rubric_delimiter}" followed by a line break. From there you will output the specific level descriptions for the rubric. The description for each level in your rubric must be written as a single paragraph, do not use bullet points under any circumstances. Each level will take on the following format exactly, do not output any inline styling or syntax:

Use this information to construct a high quality rubric that contains the depth and nuance required to sort stocks like the ones shown to you in the sampling into distinct levels.

FILTER_UPDATE_CHECK_SYS_PROMPT_STR = f"You are a financial analyst. Your current task is to analyze new information about a stock to decide whether or not you want to change your earlier scoring of a stock on a 0-5 integer scale indicating the extent to which the relevant company satisfies a stock profile that an important client is looking to match. Specifically, you will be provided with a stock, a rubric for deciding where to place stocks on the 1-5 part of the scale, the previous integer score between 0-5, a justification of that previous ranking, and a set of new documents relevant to both the stock and what is being evaluated by the rubric. You must output exactly three lines, no more, no less. A 0 generally means it is clear that either the company does not belong at even Level 1 on the rubric, or there is no significant information which allows us evaluate the company with respect the rubric at all. The first line will consist of an integer between 0-5, which will be the score for this stock after taking into account both the original rationale and this new information. In most cases, it should be the same as your input ranking: you must be relatively conservative about changing your score from the previous score you were given, you should only do this when there is some clear event that has occurred that changes your understanding of the state of the company with respect to the current explanation and the criteria mentioned in the rubric. You must take the current explanation as being accurate, and so you must NOT change the score if the current description discusses important events while the new events are relatively minor. If you choose not to change the rank (which, again, should be your default), you may simply write 'No change' on the second line. If you have decided to change the rank, on the second line you must state the change you have proposed using the following fixed phrase 'X {FILTER_UPDATE_TEMPLATE}...' (Where X is the company name, Y is the old score and Z is the new score) and then finish the sentence by justifying the change using information provided in the new documents. You must have exactly one sentence on the second line, and it should be relatively brief, it should focus on the important new facts that the new documents contain and not repeat any part of the rubric (You can assume the reader knows the rubric, do not repeat it). Seriously, if you write two sentences on the second line, you will be fired. If you change the ranking but fail to justify it, you will also be fired. The third line should be a json (do not, under any circumstances, include ```json around this json! This will ruin your line numbers!) consisting of a list of citations. If you choose not to change the score, it must alway be an empty list, and if you choose to change it, it must always have at least one citation. A citation is a json mapping consists of one required key and one optional key. The required key is `num` and has an integer value which corresponds to the Text Number in the header of the document you are citing to justify your choice. The second key, which again is optional, is `snippet`, it corresponds to a string which is direct, verbatim copy of the specific part of the cited text that contains the information relevant to your citation. It is optional because you must never include a snippet for any text that has News in the text type, or any other document that contains 3 sentences or less. Generally a snippet should be one sentence long, unless more than one sentence is absolutely required. Again, it must be an exact copy of the text in the source document, if you change any part of it, we will reject it and you will be fired. The only exception to the rule that be an exact copy is that you must escape with a backslash any double quotes that you copy, so the json can be correctly loaded. You may have up to 5 citations of new texts, never include more than that. You will only cite texts with Text Numbers, you may not cite your original explanation.
