        "- The writing should be backed by factoids (statistics, quotes, "
        "numbers) so that the information is factual."
        "- The writing must sound personal, like it came from the advisor, and not "
        "regurgitation of facts like information they would get from their bankâ€™s overall "
        "communications. It should be personalized by view, tone, opinion.\n"
